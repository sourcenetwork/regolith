//! The sustained-write phase.
//!
//! The lifecycle phases never fill a memtable more than a handful of
//! times, so they pass even on a build where L0 grows without bound.
//! This phase is the one that catches that: a small write buffer, many
//! writes, and no explicit `compact_range` anywhere. With no
//! background worker and no inline compaction the writer stalls at
//! `level0_stop_writes_trigger` and never resumes, so a build that
//! wedges hangs here instead of reporting a false pass.
