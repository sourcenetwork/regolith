# Development Principles

## 0. What Regolith Is

**regolith** (crate: `regolith`, v0.1.1) is a pure Rust, embedded LSM-tree key-value store built from scratch. The architecture follows the LevelDB design (memtable → WAL → leveled SSTables → background compaction); the public API is shaped to slot into common embedded-KV abstraction layers so consuming applications can swap regolith in alongside other backends through the same trait.

Early-stage. The public API (`Db`, `Snapshot`, `WriteBatch`, `Options`) is small and stable-shaped, but breakage is allowed pre-1.0.

### Design goals

- **Pure Rust, no FFI** — no C/C++ toolchain, no `bindgen`, no linker surprises in the library or checked-in workspace tools
- **LSM-tree** — write-optimized with level-based background compaction
- **MVCC** — point-in-time consistent reads via global sequence numbers
- **Crash recovery** — WAL with xxhash-checksummed records
- **Concurrent reads** — lock-free memtable via `crossbeam-skiplist`
- **No async runtime required** — compaction runs on a dedicated OS thread

## 1. Information Hygiene

This codebase is designed for **AI-human pair programming**. Every structural choice optimizes for **rapid context acquisition**.

**Context clarity is oxygen for productive collaboration.**

## 2. Temporal Boundaries

| Zone        | Contains                | Lives in                        |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Past**    | How we got here         | Git history, closed issues/PRs  |
| **Present** | What the code does now  | Working tree                    |
| **Future**  | What we might do next   | GitHub issues                   |

**No commented-out code. No TODO comments (create issues instead). No speculative docs.**

## 3. No Documentation Files

Only allowed: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `Cargo.toml`, `LICENSE-*`.

No `ROADMAP.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `docs/` directories, or planning documents.

## 4. File Organization

**One concept per file. Small files over large files for new code.**

```

### Public API surface

`lib.rs` is the public surface. Core types include `Db`, `Snapshot`,
`WriteBatch`, `Options`, `WriteOptions`, `Iter`, `TailingIter`, `Error`,
and `Result`. Extension surfaces such as column families, transactions,
TTL, backups, checkpoints, external SST ingestion, statistics, event
listeners, merge operators, compaction filters, and rate limiting are
also re-exported from `lib.rs`. Anything not re-exported is internal.

### File Size Guidelines

- Under 200 lines: Fine
- 200–400 lines: Check if doing one thing
- Over 400 lines: Consider splitting

Several core engine files are intentionally larger today because they
still carry early-stage API and storage-engine code together. Treat that
as refactoring debt: split them only behind focused issues or while
touching a cohesive area with tests, and keep new modules small.

## 5. Naming Conventions

| Thing         | Convention           | Example              |
| ------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Files/Modules | snake_case           | `block_cache.rs`     |
| Types         | PascalCase           | `WriteBatch`         |
| Functions     | snake_case           | `flush_memtable()`   |
| Constants     | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE | `BLOCK_FOOTER_SIZE`  |

## 6. Comments Policy

**Minimal comments. Code should be self-documenting.**

✅ Comment: Non-obvious WHY, safety invariants, on-disk format descriptions, public API docs (`///`)

❌ Don't: What the code does, TODO/FIXME, commented-out code, change history

## 7. Architecture at a Glance

**Write path:** `put`/`delete`/`write` → append to WAL → insert into active memtable → when memtable is full, swap to immutable and flush to an L0 SSTable → background compaction merges L0→L1 and promotes levels (each 10× larger than the last).

**Read path:** active memtable → frozen memtables → L0 SSTables (bloom filter pre-check, overlap possible) → L1..L6 (sorted, non-overlapping, binary search). The first hit wins.

**MVCC:** every write increments a global sequence number. `snapshot()` captures the current seq; reads through a `Snapshot` ignore any key whose seq is greater. This is how point-in-time isolation works without locks on the read path.

**Durability:** `DurabilityMode::Immediate` fsyncs the WAL per write; `Eventual` (default) leaves it to the OS.

## 8. Git Worktree Workflow

```bash
git worktree add ../regolith-foo -b feat/foo    # Work on feature foo
git worktree add ../regolith-bar -b feat/bar    # Work on feature bar
git worktree remove ../regolith-foo             # Clean up
```

Each worktree is isolated, no branch-switching overhead.

## Build Dependencies

- **Rust** 1.90+ (edition 2024) for the library build (see `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`); CI runs tests and tools on stable Rust.

That's it for the checked-in workspace. No `protoc`, no `cbindgen`, no C/C++ toolchain, no system libraries. Workspace tool dependencies must also parse and build on the MSRV toolchain because CI runs `cargo check --workspace` on Rust 1.90. Tools that need foreign libraries, bindgen-based comparison backends, or newer toolchains should live outside this workspace so the main CI path remains pure Rust.

## Common Commands

```bash
cargo test --workspace                         # Run library, integration, and tool tests
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings # Lint all workspace targets (matches CI)
cargo fmt --all -- --check                     # Format check (matches CI)
cargo fmt                                      # Apply formatting
cargo build --release                          # Optimized build (LTO, strip)
```

Use inline `#[cfg(test)]` tests for module-local invariants and `tests/`
for public-API integration, corruption, concurrency, parity, and property
tests. Keep fuzz harnesses under `fuzz/`; they are not part of the normal
workspace test run.

## Before Committing

1. `cargo test --workspace` passes
2. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean
3. `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean
4. `cargo deny check` clean — surfaces RUSTSEC advisories, license violations, and duplicate crates against the allow-list in `deny.toml`

These are the local gates mirrored in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
CI also builds docs with `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps`, checks the
library and tools on the MSRV toolchain with `cargo check --workspace`,
and runs scheduled ignored stress tests.

CI also publishes a coverage summary via `cargo llvm-cov --summary-only` on every push; run it locally with `cargo llvm-cov` (HTML report lands in `target/llvm-cov/html/`) when a change touches a file whose coverage you care about. No hard gate yet — the baseline at the time of writing is ~93% regions / ~91% lines.

## Goal

**A new contributor should be able to read this file, skim `src/lib.rs`, and start making productive changes to the engine within an hour.**

Fast context acquisition → Confident changes → Productive iteration.
