---- MODULE RepeatableReadCommit ----
\* ===========================================================================
\* THE STORY
\* ===========================================================================
\* A transaction is a batch of reads and writes that must look as if it ran
\* alone. Regolith's optimistic transactions do not lock anything while they
\* run. Each one reads from a frozen picture of the database (its snapshot),
\* remembers what it read and what it wants to write, and at the very end asks
\* to commit. The commit then checks: did anybody else change, since my
\* snapshot, something I relied on? If so the transaction is refused (it
\* "aborts") and the caller runs it again. This check is "validation".
\*
\* Tiny example. Two people each read a counter that says 5 and each write
\* back 6. If both commits are let through, the counter says 6 and one
\* increment is lost. Validation refuses the second commit, because the key
\* it read has a newer write than its snapshot.
\*
\* What can go wrong, both ways:
\*   - validate too little, and a transaction commits on stale input (the
\*     lost increment above);
\*   - validate too much, and transactions that could never hurt each other
\*     are refused for nothing (two appends to different places, two writes of
\*     the very same bytes).
\*
\* How much is validated depends on the isolation level (IsolationLevel,
\* src/transaction.rs), and at DefraLevel also on what the caller declares
\* about each key (KeyClass and KeyClassifier, src/transaction/policy.rs).
\* This module writes that rule down exactly. RepeatableRead.tla, which
\* extends this one, runs workloads against it and checks that nothing stale
\* commits and nothing harmless is refused. Read its header first for the
\* workloads and the promises; this file holds what every workload shares:
\* the fixed inputs, the layout of the keys, the variables, the history of
\* committed writes, and the commit rule. The two files are one model, split
\* only to keep each readable.
\*
\* WHERE EACH RULE COMES FROM, with the code it mirrors (checked against the
\* code of this branch). Section numbers in brackets are sections of the
\* design, docs/plans/defralevel.md. A RED configuration per rule breaks it
\* on purpose (RepeatableRead.tla, MUTANTS).
\*
\*   Transaction::observe, Transaction::validation_set    src/transaction.rs
\*   TxnScanStream and its yield_cursor               src/transaction/cursor.rs
\*   scan_range::cover                            src/transaction/scan_range.rs
\*         Point reads, scan stretches, which reads a level validates, and
\*         the written keys a stretch covers.
\*   policy::run_is_commutative                       src/transaction/policy.rs
\*         A stretch inside one commutative prefix records nothing.
\*   policy::exempt_content_addressed (E17, D7)       src/transaction/policy.rs
\*         A put or merge of a content-addressed key is never validated,
\*         and neither is any read of a key the commit puts or merges. A
\*         delete of one is validated as for any key. A read of one that
\*         found it is validated for presence only; one that found nothing
\*         is validated in full.
\*   RegolithEngine::validate                         src/engine/commit/txn.rs
\*         The read loop, then the validated ranges, then the write loop.
\*         A presence-only read does not stand for a write of its key
\*         (read_stands_for, src/engine/commit/early.rs), so a deleted
\*         content-addressed key is checked by both loops.
\*   RegolithEngine::check_write              src/engine/commit/write_check.rs
\*   RegolithEngine::landed_above              src/engine/commit/terminator.rs
\*         One written key against the versions newer than the snapshot. A
\*         blind merge at DefraLevel aborts only on a newer replacement. An
\*         identical blind write is elided, except under a merge of its own
\*         batch (write_matches_committed, src/engine/mod.rs; its operand
\*         clause is left out, see Elided).
\*   ReadRule::Value, RegolithEngine::read_changed [3.5]
\*                              src/engine/read_rule.rs, commit/read_rules.rs
\*         Value-validated reads. At DefraLevel a read is current when the
\*         key's newest committed write is a put or a delete that leaves
\*         exactly the value the read returned. A newer operand on top is a
\*         change. Every other level compares sequences (ReadRule::Seq).
\*   Transaction::get_parts, ReadRule::Parts [3.3, 3.4]
\*                                                src/transaction/projection.rs
\*         Projected reads. Validated only against newer writes that change
\*         one of the named parts: a put, delete or range delete always does
\*         (unless it leaves exactly the bytes read), an operand does when
\*         MergeOperator::touches says so. In full when the read found
\*         nothing or the transaction puts the key; never with no part
\*         named. Like any read but a presence read, it stands for a write
\*         of its key, which is why the put fallback is needed.
\*   RegolithEngine::commit_write_free [3.8, E50]     src/engine/commit/mod.rs
\*   Transaction::drain_for_commit                              src/transaction.rs
\*         Write-free transactions. A commit with no put, delete, merge or
\*         append takes no part in the commit pipeline, at every level and
\*         in both flavours: it takes no sequence, checks what its level
\*         checks against the published state, commits on a database
\*         latched read-only, and its receipt names its snapshot. An
\*         optimistic DefraLevel one checks only its get_for_update reads; a
\*         pessimistic one validates as at RepeatableRead.
\*   KeyClass::Log, Transaction::append [3.2, 3.6]    src/transaction/append.rs
\*         Log keys. A read of a key of the log range is never validated at
\*         DefraLevel. Only `append` writes the log, in the ordered step
\*         (AppendOrder::number, src/engine/commit/append.rs): the position
\*         is assigned at commit, so the appending transaction never sees
\*         its own entry.
\*   RangeCheck, RegolithEngine::written_in_range_of [3.15]
\*                    src/transaction/validated_range.rs, commit/range_rule.rs
\*         Validated scans. Any newer write inside the range the scan
\*         covered conflicts, so a key that left the range (a revocation)
\*         and a key that appeared in it (a phantom) both abort the scan.
\*   KeyWrites::fold [3.9]                         src/transaction/write_buffer.rs
\*         Read-your-own-writes in operation order. A transaction's read
\*         applies its own puts, deletes and merges in the order it made
\*         them, and its commit stores the same fold. The 0.1.x engine
\*         applied a put before a merge whatever their order (MUTANT
\*         PutsBeforeMerges).
\*   E11 (#236). A merge made before a scan keeps the scan's stretch: the
\*         scan reads the operands-only key's base without recording it.
\*   Conflict [3.14]                                           src/conflict.rs
\*         Conflict reasons. An abort carries (key, mine, theirs,
\*         observed_seq, latest_seq): what this transaction did with the
\*         key, and the newer committed write that decided the race.
\*
\* THE HISTORY. `hist` holds every committed write as a record: the commit
\* sequence, the key, the kind (Put, Delete, RangeDelete, Merge: the
\* engine's WriteKind, src/conflict.rs), the value the key held right after
\* it, and for an operand the parts it touches. A commit takes one sequence
\* here where the engine gives each operation its own; a key that one commit
\* both puts and merges gets a Put and a Merge record at that sequence, the
\* Merge being the newer (Newer). Every rule below reads the history the way
\* the engine walks the versions newer than a snapshot, newest first. Each
\* step keeps only what an open snapshot can still read (Prune), as
\* compaction does.
\*
\* LEAN. proofs/lean/Regolith/Validation.lean proves, for every history
\* size, that these per-class rules accept only histories equivalent to the
\* serial one in commit order (all_classes_serial);
\* proofs/lean/Regolith/Relaxations.lean states each class's relaxation
\* exactly; proofs/lean/Regolith/MergeOperator.lean proves the merge-operator
\* laws the blind-merge and projected-read rules rest on. RepeatableRead.tla's
\* header names every theorem.

\* Borrow the standard TLA+ books: counting numbers, sizes of finite sets, lists, and TLC's helpers
\* for writing small maps (:> and @@).
EXTENDS Naturals, FiniteSets, Sequences, TLC

\* The fixed inputs a configuration (an MC_*.cfg file) chooses. Every transaction is named by a
\* number, its id.
CONSTANTS
  \* The transactions that each append one block to the Merkle DAG. An appender's id doubles as the
  \* id of its block.
  Appenders,
  \* The block that is already the DAG's only head before anything runs.
  Seed,
  \* The one transaction that sweeps away head keys a newer block superseded.
  Pruner,
  \* The one transaction that reads the collection definition and writes a document from it.
  Writer,
  \* The one transaction that replaces the definition with its next version.
  Patcher,
  \* The transactions that each apply the same block received from a peer (the remote block). May be
  \* empty.
  Mergers,
  \* The id of that remote block.
  Remote,
  \* The blocks the remote block names as its parents. Its bytes fix them, not what the local heads
  \* happen to be.
  RemoteParents,
  \* The transactions that add one to the counter with a merge and read nothing first (a blind
  \* merge). May be empty.
  Incrementers,
  \* The transactions that read the counter and then merge an increment into it. May be empty.
  ReadMergers,
  \* The transactions that put the counter to 1 and merge an increment on top, in one commit. May be
  \* empty.
  Rebasers,
  \* The transactions that delete the counter. May be empty.
  Resetters,
  \* The plain range deletes over the counter's range, made outside any transaction
  \* (Db::delete_range, src/lib.rs). May be empty.
  Clearers,
  \* The transactions that scan up to the definition and then rewrite it. May be empty.
  Migrators,
  \* The transactions of the later workloads, as one set of ids per role name (RoleNames below). A
  \* configuration picks one of the records RepeatableRead.tla defines, for example Extras <-
  \* NoExtras.
  Extras,
  \* The key ranges the caller's KeyClassifier (src/transaction/policy.rs) declares
  \* KeyClass::CommutativePrefix.
  CommutativeRanges,
  \* The key ranges it declares KeyClass::ContentAddressed: keys named after their own bytes, so one
  \* key never holds two different values.
  ContentAddressedRanges,
  \* The isolation level every transaction runs at, one of the names of IsolationLevel
  \* (src/transaction.rs): "ReadCommitted", "SnapshotIsolation", "RepeatableRead", "Serializable" or
  \* "DefraLevel". The two writers of the read-only anomaly run at SnapshotIsolation whatever it says
  \* (LevelOf below).
  Level,
  \* "none" for the real rules, or the name of the one rule a RED configuration breaks on purpose
  \* (the list is in RepeatableRead.tla, MUTANTS).

              "Joiners", "Claimers", "Peekers", "NoPartDeciders"}
\* A configuration must give every role a set of transaction ids, possibly an empty one.
ASSUME Extras \in [RoleNames -> SUBSET Nat]
\* Two roles never share a transaction.
ASSUME \A r1, r2 \in RoleNames : r1 # r2 => Extras[r1] \cap Extras[r2] = {}

\* One name per role, so the rules read as the workloads are described.
\* Collectors: garbage collection. A collector deletes the shared block when nothing refers to it.
Collectors     == Extras["Collectors"]
\* Linkers: each puts the shared block again (or merges the block's own bytes into it) and writes a
\* pin that refers to it.
Linkers        == Extras["Linkers"]
\* Holders: each reads the shared block and writes down whether it was there.
Holders        == Extras["Holders"]
\* Part readers: each calls get_parts(part key, {1}) and decides on part 1 only.
PartReaders    == Extras["PartReaders"]
\* Part rewriters: each calls get_parts(part key, {1}) and then puts the whole key back.
PartRewriters  == Extras["PartRewriters"]
\* Part writers: each makes one blind write of the part key, picked when it begins.
PartWriters    == Extras["PartWriters"]
\* Value readers: each reads the version key and decides on the value it found.
ValueReaders   == Extras["ValueReaders"]
\* Version writers: each rewrites the version key, with the same bytes or with different ones.
VersionWriters == Extras["VersionWriters"]
\* Read-only transactions: optimistic, they read both skew keys and write nothing.
ReadOnlys      == Extras["ReadOnlys"]
\* Promoters: pessimistic and write-free; each reads one key later than its snapshot, with
\* get_for_update.
Promoters      == Extras["Promoters"]
\* Skew writers: each writes both skew keys in one commit.
SkewWriters    == Extras["SkewWriters"]
\* For-update readers: optimistic and write-free; each reads skew key A plainly and skew key B with
\* get_for_update, both at its snapshot (an optimistic transaction reads everything there).
ForUpdateReaders == Extras["ForUpdateReaders"]
\* Latchers: not transactions. Each is one failure (a log write that failed, a callback that
\* panicked) that latches the database read-only: from then on every commit that writes is refused.
Latchers       == Extras["Latchers"]
\* Withdrawers: the bank's withdrawal of the read-only anomaly. Each reads both skew keys (balance A
\* and balance B) and puts A to A + B, a value that tells which B it read. Runs at
\* SnapshotIsolation.
Withdrawers    == Extras["Withdrawers"]
\* Depositors: the bank's deposit. Each reads balance B and puts it one higher. Runs at
\* SnapshotIsolation.
Depositors     == Extras["Depositors"]
\* Reporters: the read-only report of the anomaly. Each reads both balances and writes nothing, at
\* the configuration's Level.
Reporters      == Extras["Reporters"]
\* Log appenders: each appends one entry to the log.
LogAppenders   == Extras["LogAppenders"]
\* Log readers: each reads the log's head, appends an entry, and stores the head it read as its
\* cursor.
LogReaders     == Extras["LogReaders"]
\* Log deciders: the misuse case. Each bases a decision on a read of the log.
LogDeciders    == Extras["LogDeciders"]
\* Tally mergers: each merges into a key of a commutative prefix and then scans that prefix.
TallyMergers   == Extras["TallyMergers"]
\* Own-writers: each does two operations on one key and then reads the key back.
OwnWriters     == Extras["OwnWriters"]
\* Checkers: each decides on everything a range holds, using a validated scan.
Checkers       == Extras["Checkers"]
\* Revokers: each deletes a key of that range.
Revokers       == Extras["Revokers"]
\* Granters: each puts a new key into that range.
Granters       == Extras["Granters"]
\* Joiners: each scans the roster, a commutative prefix, and adds a key of its own to it. It decides
\* nothing on what the scan returned: the use the prefix is declared for.
Joiners        == Extras["Joiners"]
\* Claimers: the misuse case. Each scans the roster and takes the one seat when the scan showed it
\* free: an exclusive outcome decided on a scan.
Claimers       == Extras["Claimers"]
\* Peekers: each calls get_parts(part key, {}), naming no part, and decides on nothing it read.
Peekers        == Extras["Peekers"]
\* No-part deciders: the misuse case. Each calls get_parts(part key, {}) and still decides on part 1.
NoPartDeciders == Extras["NoPartDeciders"]

\* Every transaction of the later workloads.
NewTxns == UNION {Extras[r] : r \in RoleNames}

RosterLow       == <<RosterRange, 0, 0>>
\* The roster's one seat. It sorts between the first and the last key, so it lies inside the
\* stretch any scan of the roster walks.
SeatKey         == <<RosterRange, 1, 0>>

MaxKey(S) == CHOOSE k \in S : \A j \in S : KeyLeq(j, k)

\* A value is a natural; 0 is an absent key, and a delete intends 0. The
\* counter's value is its count, so an absent counter counts 0.
Absent == 0

\* The part key's value carries two parts as digits: part 1 is the ones
\* digit, part 2 the tens digit, so 11 is "both parts at 1". A present value

Parts == {1, 2}

\* The state: everything that changes from one step to the next. Each line says what the variable

VARIABLES
  \* The newest committed sequence number: every commit takes the next one. It is the engine's
  \* horizon, where a new transaction takes its snapshot
  \* (RegolithEngine::register_snapshot_at_horizon, src/engine/mod.rs).
  clock,
  \* What a read of each key returns right now, as a map from key to value (0 for an absent key):
  \* the database as its newest reader sees it.
  store,
  \* Every committed write still worth remembering, as a set of records (THE HISTORY above): the
  \* versions the engine keeps in its memtables and tables, each stamped with its sequence and kind
  \* (src/engine/internal_key.rs).
  hist,
  \* Where each transaction is in its life: "idle" (not begun), "open", "committed", "aborted" (it
  \* lost a race) or "failed" (a database latched read-only refused its writes) (a Transaction,
  \* src/transaction.rs).
  phase,
  \* The sequence each transaction took as its snapshot when it began (Transaction::snapshot_seq).
  snap,
  \* The keys each transaction read one by one and recorded, each answered as of its snapshot
  \* (Transaction::tracked, one KeyState per key).
  tracked,
  \* The stretches each transaction's scans walked, each a pair <<first key, last key>> (ScanRun,
  \* src/transaction/scan_range.rs).
  runs,
  \* The keys each transaction's commit puts or deletes (the buffered Write::Put and Write::Delete,
  \* src/transaction/write_buffer.rs).
  written,
  \* The keys each transaction's commit merges an operand into (the buffered Write::Merge, same
  \* file).
  merged,
  \* What each put or deleted key will hold after the commit (0 for a delete).
  intended,
  \* A value a transaction read and then built its write from: the definition the writer or a
  \* migrator read, or the count a read-merger read. Model bookkeeping, used only to notice a stale
  \* write.
  seen,
  \* The operations an own-writer or a part writer chose, as a list in the order it made them.
  ops,
  \* The get_for_update reads a pessimistic transaction made later than its snapshot, each as <<key,
  \* the sequence it was served at>> (KeyState::for_update, src/transaction.rs).
  forUpdate,
  \* The anomalies and needless refusals noticed so far, as a set of names from FlagNames. Model
  \* bookkeeping: the engine has no such variable.
  flags,
  \* For each committed block, the parents it recorded. Model bookkeeping for the head-set check.
  parents,
  \* TRUE once some write committed although the definition it was built from had been replaced.
  \* Model bookkeeping.
  stale,
  \* TRUE once a merger was refused although every newer write to its keys stored exactly what it
  \* writes. Model bookkeeping.
  dupRefused,
  \* TRUE once a read-merger committed although the count it read had moved. Model bookkeeping.
  wrongReceipt,
  \* TRUE once a blind increment was refused although committing it would have been correct. Model
  \* bookkeeping.
  needlessRefusal,
  \* The counter's contract, part 1: what the last put, delete or range delete stored in it. Model
  \* bookkeeping (a "ghost": the engine has no such variable).
  cbase,
  \* The counter's contract, part 2: the sequence that write committed at.
  cepoch,
  \* The counter's contract, part 3: the commit sequences of the increments counted on top of that
  \* write.
  cinc,
  \* The sequence each committed transaction's receipt carries (CommitReceipt::seq,
  \* src/transaction/receipt.rs): the one its writes took, or its snapshot when it wrote nothing.
  receipt,
  \* TRUE once a failure latched the database read-only (RegolithEngine::is_latched,
  \* src/engine/mod.rs): every commit that writes is refused from then on.
  latched

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* THE HISTORY, read the way the engine walks a key's versions.

\* Record a is newer than record b: a later commit, or, within one commit,
\* the operand above the put it was merged onto. Records of one commit for
\* different keys are ordered by key, so the order is total.
Newer(a, b) ==
  \* a later commit is newer;
  \/ a.seq > b.seq
  \* within one commit, an operand is newer than a record that is not one (the operand was merged
  \* onto the put);
  \/ a.seq = b.seq /\ a.kind = "Merge" /\ b.kind # "Merge"
  \* within one commit, two operands or two non-operands of different keys are ordered by key. This
  \* only makes the order total.
  \/ a.seq = b.seq /\ (a.kind = "Merge") = (b.kind = "Merge")
     \* (That key comparison: b's key sorts before a's, and they differ.)
     /\ KeyLeq(b.key, a.key) /\ a.key # b.key

\* The newest record of a nonempty set of records.
Newest(S) == CHOOSE w \in S : \A v \in S : v = w \/ Newer(w, v)

\* The writes of key k committed after sequence s: what a snapshot at s
\* does not see.
After(k, s) == {w \in hist : w.key = k /\ w.seq > s}

\* What key k held at sequence s: the value its newest write at or below s
\* left, or its initial value. A read at snapshot s returns this.
ValueAt(k, s) ==
  \* S: the writes of key k at or below sequence s.
  LET S == {w \in hist : w.key = k /\ w.seq <= s}
  \* With none, the key still holds its starting value; otherwise the value the newest of them left.
  IN IF S = {} THEN InitStore[k] ELSE Newest(S).val

\* The newest committed entry of key k is an unresolved merge operand.
NewestIsOperand(k) ==
  \* S is every write of k. The key has one, and the newest is an operand.
  LET S == {w \in hist : w.key = k} IN S # {} /\ Newest(S).kind = "Merge"

\* The oldest sequence any open transaction can still read at: the oldest
\* open snapshot, or the current sequence when none is open (a transaction
\* that begins later snapshots there). ph and cl are the phases and the
\* sequence after the step.
Horizon(ph, cl) ==
  \* open: the snapshots of the transactions still open, together with the current sequence.
  LET open == {snap[t] : t \in {u \in Txns : ph[u] = "open"}} \cup {cl}
  \* The smallest of them.
  IN CHOOSE m \in open : \A n \in open : m <= n

\* The history h with what no open snapshot can read folded away, as
\* compaction folds versions per live snapshot: every record newer than the
\* horizon stays, and of the older ones only each key's newest, which
\* ValueAt needs for a read at the horizon or later. Every rule and ghost
\* reads the history at an open transaction's anchors (all at or above the
\* horizon) or its newest entries, so this changes no verdict; it only
\* merges states that differ in history nobody can see.
Prune(h, ph, cl) ==
  \* hz: the oldest sequence anyone can still read at.
  LET hz == Horizon(ph, cl)
  \* Keep a record when it is newer than that,
  IN {r \in h : \/ r.seq > hz
                \* or when it is the newest record of its key at or below that: the one a read at
                \* the horizon returns.
                \/ r = Newest({q \in h : q.key = r.key /\ q.seq <= hz})}

\* through the last key of range hi.

\* The keys it yields.
Yield(S, lo, hi) == {k \in S : lo <= k[1] /\ k[1] <= hi}

\* TxnScanStream::yield_cursor: the stretch it records, first and last key,
\* none when it yields nothing.
Stretch(Y) == IF Y = {} THEN {} ELSE {<<MinKey(Y), MaxKey(Y)>>}

\* TxnScanStream::yield_cursor: the yielded keys it records as reads, only

\* their level.
ScanReads(Y) == IF Level = "Serializable" THEN Y ELSE {}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* WHO CONSULTS THE CLASSIFIER.

\* The level transaction t runs at (TxnOptions::isolation, src/transaction/txn_options.rs). The

\* SnapshotIsolation beside a report at the configuration's Level, and every other role runs at
\* Level.
LevelOf(t) == IF t \in Withdrawers \cup Depositors THEN "SnapshotIsolation" ELSE Level

\* A pessimistic transaction (TransactionDb, src/transaction.rs). At DefraLevel it validates exactly
\* as at RepeatableRead and consults no classifier [3.1].

Appends(t) == t \in LogAppenders \cup LogReaders

\* Plan section [3.8]: DefraLevel's write-free relaxation (drain_for_commit's `relaxed`). A
\* write-free optimistic DefraLevel transaction validates no plain read and no scan: its snapshot is
\* consistent on its own; it still checks what it read with get_for_update (KeptReads). MUTANT
\* WriteFreePessimistic extends that to a pessimistic one, which the plan rejects; MUTANT
\* WriteFreeUnchecked to a write-free transaction at any level.

     \* or the planted bug WriteFreeUnchecked lets every write-free transaction skip it.
     \/ Mutant = "WriteFreeUnchecked"

\* policy::exempt_content_addressed: the content-addressed keys the commit
\* puts or merges, which nothing validates. The newest write decides, so a
\* key put (intended not absent) or merged counts; a key only deleted does
\* not. MUTANT CaDeleteExempt exempts a delete too (the rule before E17).
CaExempt(t) ==
  \* Of the keys the commit writes or merges into, those where:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* THE READS A COMMIT VALIDATES. Each is a record: the key, the anchor (the
\* sequence the read was served at), the access a conflict reason names,
\* the rule that validates it, and the parts it names (all parts unless it
\* is a projected read). The rules:
\*   "seq"       any newer write conflicts (every level but DefraLevel)
\*   "value"     Plan section [3.5]: the newest newer write conflicts unless it is a
\*               put or delete leaving exactly the value read
\*   "presence"  E17: conflicts only when the newest write left the key absent
\*   "parts"     Plan section [3.4]: walk newest first to the first write that

\* The class rule for one plain read (a point read, a get_for_update, or a
\* written key a scan stretch covers): the read records it keeps, none when
\* the class drops it.
\*   Log key             never validated (Plan section [3.2]).
\*   content-addressed   E17/D7: a read of a key the commit puts or merges is
