---- MODULE TxnCallbacks ----
\* ===========================================================================
\* THE STORY, for a reader who has never seen the code
\* ===========================================================================
\* A transaction is a batch of reads and writes that either all take effect
\* (it "commits") or none do (it "aborts"). A caller can hang three kinds of
\* callback on one (src/transaction/callbacks.rs): before_commit runs just
\* before the commit is decided and may still write; on_commit runs after
\* the transaction committed; on_abort runs after it ended without
\* committing. A database can also have "hooks" (TransactionHooks): the same
\* three points, for every transaction.
\*
\* Tiny example. A shop sends "your order is placed" from on_commit and
\* releases the reserved stock from on_abort. If both ran, or neither, or
\* on_commit ran twice, or on_commit ran before the order was safely on disk
\* and the machine then lost power, the customer would be told something
\* false. And several threads can reach for the same outcome: the owner of
\* the transaction, the thread that delivers a finished commit, and `close`,
\* which aborts whatever is still open.
\*
\* What the model shows: with two callers that each may retry once, and
\* close racing them, every callback runs exactly once, of the right kind,
\* in the right order, on the right thread, and only after the commit is on
\* disk when the database promises that. Each RED configuration plants one
\* bug, and TLC must then find the broken promise.
\*
\* THE TWO FORMS OF COMMIT, both modelled as the code has them.
\*   - The blocking commit. `transact` (src/transaction/retry.rs, `run`)
\*     calls Transaction::commit (src/transaction.rs). The call claims the
\*     transaction, runs the before_commit callbacks, joins the commit
\*     pipeline and waits inside the call for its decision and, at
\*     Immediate, for the fsync of its commit group. Then it runs the
\*     outcome's callbacks itself, on the calling thread, and returns. There
\*     is no ticket.
\*   - commit_nowait. `transact_async` (`run_async`) calls
\*     Transaction::commit_nowait (src/transaction/nowait.rs) on the
\*     caller's queue. It runs the same way up to the pipeline's decision
\*     and never waits for an fsync. A commit whose group owes none (a
\*     conflict, or Eventual durability) is done: its callbacks run on the
\*     calling thread before the call returns, and the ticket it returns is
\*     ready. A commit whose group owes its fsync returns a pending
\*     CommitTicket that holds a closure to read the outcome from the group
\*     later (Completion::resolve_with, src/io_queue/completion.rs). When
\*     the group has landed, the commit's queue is told; at that queue's
\*     poll, or at its drop, on the thread that holds the queue, the
\*     delivery takes the closure, decides the outcome with it, claims it
\*     with one compare-and-swap and runs the callbacks. So such a commit is
\*     resolved at delivery, on the committing thread, and never before its
\*     fsync.
\*
\* Transaction callbacks (plan 3.16, D44): before_commit, on_commit,
\* on_abort and the database-wide TransactionHooks, for transactions run by
\* `transact` (3.10) and completed on the committing thread (the queue's
\* poll or drop), by `close` or by the owner.

\*
\* THE DESIGN (plan 3.16).
\*   - Exactly one outcome. For every transaction, exactly one of on_commit
\*     or on_abort runs, once per registered callback, however the outcome
\*     arrives: a ticket, close or a drop.
\*   - On the committing thread (D53). A committed or conflicted outcome is
\*     told, and its callbacks run, only on the committing thread: the
\*     thread that called the commit, for a blocking commit and for a
\*     commit_nowait that was done when it returned; the thread that owns
\*     the commit's queue, for a pending ticket (at that queue's poll, or
\*     when the queue is dropped, on the dropping thread, which then holds
\*     it). Never on a committer that decided it or synced it. Close runs
\*     only the on_abort of transactions still open, on the closing thread;
\*     the owner's own rollback, drop or error runs on the owner's thread.
\*   - Order. At commit, the transaction's before_commit callbacks run, then
\*     the database hooks', then validation; a write a callback makes is
\*     part of the commit and is validated. After the outcome, the
\*     transaction's callbacks run first, then the hooks'.
\*   - Attempts. Callbacks belong to one attempt. On a conflict under
\*     `transact`, that attempt's on_abort callbacks run with the Conflict,
\*     its on_commit callbacks are dropped, and the re-run registers its own.
\*   - on_commit runs when the commit is visible, and durable at Immediate.
\*   - A panic in before_commit fails the commit with CallbackPanicked and
\*     runs on_abort.
\*   - close runs the on_abort callbacks of transactions still open, and
\*     resolves the tickets its final sync covers.
\*
\* THE MECHANISM MODELLED for exactly-once: two claims, each one CAS.
\*   - The transaction's state word: "open" is CAS'd once, to "committing"
\*     by its owner's commit or to "aborted" by a rollback, a drop, an
\*     error or close. Whoever loses the CAS runs nothing: a commit that
\*     finds the transaction aborted by close returns Closed.
\*   - The ticket's outcome word (Completion::state), for a commit_nowait
\*     that was owed an fsync: "pending" until a delivery takes the ticket's
\*     resolving closure, which only one path can get, and decides the
\*     outcome; then "decided" is CAS'd once to "delivering" by the path
\*     that delivers it, the queue's poll or the queue's drop, both on the
\*     queue holder's thread; only the winner runs callbacks.
\*
\* THE WORKLOAD. Each transaction's body writes a key of its own; its
\* before_commit callback reads a shared counter at the transaction's
\* snapshot and writes it plus one. Validation is first-committer-wins on
\* the validated write set. So the counter equals the number of commits
\* exactly when every callback write is validated.
\*
\* WHAT THE MODEL LEAVES OUT, and why that loses nothing.
\*   - One callback of each kind per attempt. With any number of them,
\*     Callbacks.lean proves the outcome callbacks run in registration
\*     order (finish_commit_runs, finish_abort_runs). That before_commit
\*     callbacks run oldest first holds by construction of its runBefore
\*     step; no theorem restates it.
\*   - Rollback, drop and an Err from the closure are one transition (the
\*     owner claims "aborted" and runs on_abort); an Err from before_commit
\*     is the panic transition without the panic flag.
\*   - The pipeline decides one transaction per step; group commit and the
\*     visibility order are GroupCommit.tla's and CommitPipeline.tla's.
\*   - Which thread runs a commit group's fsync: a pipeline thread, a
\*     member that committed with a blocking call, or the poll of a member's
\*     queue that claimed it as one unit. That is NonBlocking.tla's
\*     (MC_NonBlocking_Green_Commit); here some pipeline thread syncs.
\*   - The third delivery path, the commit's own fallback when its queue
\*     was dropped before the ticket was registered (it lands the group and
\*     delivers on the calling thread). It is the drop path with the caller
\*     as the thread that holds the queue.
\*   - The ticket's on_complete callbacks, which run after the outcome's
\*     own on the same thread and in the same claim.
\*
\* CONFIGURATIONS.
\*   MC_TxnCallbacks_Green_Immediate   one blocking commit and one
\*                                     commit_nowait, two committers, a
\*                                     pending ticket delivered by poll or
\*                                     drop, close, at Immediate: every
\*                                     invariant, and everything settles.
\*   MC_TxnCallbacks_Green_Blocking    both calls through the blocking
\*                                     commit.
\*   MC_TxnCallbacks_Green_Nowait      both through commit_nowait: two
\*                                     tickets pending at once (invariants
\*                                     only).
\*   MC_TxnCallbacks_Green_Eventual    one of each at Eventual: no ticket
\*                                     is ever pending.
\*   MC_TxnCallbacks_Red_CommitBeforeDurable  an outcome is told before the
\*                                     fsync at Immediate:
\*                                     CommitAfterDurable.
\*   MC_TxnCallbacks_Red_SkipCallbackWrites   validation uses the write
\*                                     set captured before before_commit
\*                                     ran: NoLostUpdate.
\*   MC_TxnCallbacks_Red_CallbacksSurvive     a conflicted attempt's
\*                                     callbacks stay registered for the
\*                                     re-run: AttemptIsolation.
\*   MC_TxnCallbacks_Red_DeliverNoClaim the poll and the drop deliver without
\*                                     claiming the outcome: both run it,
\*                                     AtMostOnce.
\*   MC_TxnCallbacks_Red_HelperDelivers the thread that landed a group
\*                                     resolves and delivers a member's
\*                                     ticket, as before D53: the callbacks
\*                                     run off the committing thread,
\*                                     OnCommittingThread.
\*   MC_TxnCallbacks_Red_CloseNoClaim  close aborts without claiming the
\*                                     transaction, and its commit goes on:
\*                                     AtMostOnce.

\* A committer's step.

  \* Decide a commit, sync the log, or (only under the bug HelperDelivers) claim an outcome
  \/ Decide(c) \/ Fsync(c) \/ \E x \in Owners : Claim(c, x)

  \* or close is called, or the closer takes a step.

  \* So does each committer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* Invariants.

\* Every variable holds what its comment says.
TypeOK ==
  \* Attempt numbers stay within the policy.
  /\ att \in [Owners -> 0..MaxAttempts]
  \* Each state word is one of its three values.
  /\ ost \in [Owners -> {"open", "committing", "aborted"}]
  \* Each ticket's outcome word is one of its five values.
  /\ ps \in [Owners -> {"none", "pending", "decided", "delivering", "ready"}]
  \* Each commit is nowhere in the pipeline, queued, or decided.
  /\ gs \in [Owners -> {"none", "queued", "decided"}]
  \* A ticket holds its resolving closure or it does not.
  /\ res \in [Owners -> BOOLEAN]
  \* Each verdict is one of its three values.
  /\ verdict \in [Owners -> {"none", "commit", "conflict"}]
  \* Each committer is idle or completing an outcome.
  /\ cpc \in [Committers -> {"idle", "callbacks", "hooks"}]
  \* The closer is in one of its five places.
  /\ clpc \in {"idle", "closing", "clcb", "clhook", "closed"}
  \* Each delivery path is at one of its six places.
  /\ dpc \in [Owners -> [Paths -> {"idle", "decide", "cas", "callbacks", "hooks", "spent"}]]

\* AT MOST ONCE. No attempt's callbacks run twice or both ways, and the
\* hooks' outcome runs at most once per attempt. Lean: exactly_once.
\* Example ruled out: the queue's poll and the queue's drop both deliver the
\* same commit, and the shop's "order placed" message goes out twice. The
\* program needs this because a callback acts outside the database, where
\* nothing can be rolled back.
AtMostOnce ==
  \* For every owner and attempt:
  \A x \in Owners, a \in Attempts :
    \* its on_commit and its on_abort callbacks together ran at most once;
    /\ ranC[x][a] + ranA[x][a] <= 1
    \* and so did the hooks' outcome.
    /\ hookC[x][a] + hookA[x][a] <= 1

\* Nothing is in flight: every transact call returned and every worker is
\* idle.
AllSettled ==
  \* Every transact call returned.
  /\ \A x \in Owners : opc[x] = "done"
  \* Every committer is idle.
  /\ \A c \in Committers : cpc[c] = "idle"
  \* No delivery is under way.
  /\ \A x \in Owners, p \in Paths : dpc[x][p] \in {"idle", "spent"}
  \* close was never called, or is done.
  /\ clpc \in {"idle", "closed"}
  \* Nothing waits in the pipeline.
  /\ subq = <<>>

\* EXACTLY ONCE. Once everything has settled, every attempt that began ran
\* exactly one outcome: its on_commit or its on_abort callbacks, and the
\* hooks' matching one. Lean: exactly_once.
\* Example ruled out: close and the owner each leave the abort to the other,
\* neither runs on_abort, and the reserved stock is never released. The
\* program needs this because a caller that registered a callback is waiting
\* to be told how its transaction ended.
ExactlyOnce ==
  \* Once everything has settled,
  AllSettled =>
    \A x \in Owners, a \in Attempts :
      \* for every attempt that began:
      a <= att[x] =>
        \* exactly one of its on_commit and on_abort callbacks ran;
        /\ ranC[x][a] + ranA[x][a] = 1
        \* exactly one hook outcome ran;
        /\ hookC[x][a] + hookA[x][a] = 1
        \* and on_commit ran exactly when the attempt committed.
        /\ (ranC[x][a] = 1 <=> committed[x][a])

\* A transact call commits at most once, and only with its last attempt.
\* Example ruled out: attempt 1 commits, transact runs the closure again, and
\* the caller's change is applied twice.
OneCommitPerTransact ==
  \* A committed attempt is its owner's current one: after a commit, transact starts no further
  \* attempt.
  \A x \in Owners, a \in Attempts : committed[x][a] => a = att[x]

\* ORDER. The hooks' before_commit runs after the transaction's, validation
\* after both, and the hooks' outcome after the transaction's callbacks.
\* Lean: order.
\* Example ruled out: validation runs first and a before_commit callback then
\* adds a write nobody checked; or a hook that records "committed" runs before
\* the transaction's own on_commit. The program needs this because the order
\* is documented and callers build on it.
CallbacksBeforeHooks ==
  \* For every owner and attempt:
  \A x \in Owners, a \in Attempts :
    \* the hooks' before_commit ran only after the transaction's own;
    /\ hookBefore[x][a] => beforeRan[x][a]
    \* validation ran only after the hooks' before_commit;
    /\ validated[x][a] => hookBefore[x][a]
    \* the hooks' on_commit ran only after the transaction's on_commit;
    /\ hookC[x][a] > 0 => ranC[x][a] > 0
    \* the hooks' on_abort ran only after the transaction's on_abort.
    /\ hookA[x][a] > 0 => ranA[x][a] > 0

\* BEFORE_COMMIT WRITES ARE VALIDATED. Every committed attempt's callback
\* added one to the counter it read at its snapshot; with those writes
\* validated, no two commits read the same value, so the counter is
\* exactly the number of commits. Lean: before_writes_validated.
\* Example ruled out: two transactions both read 0 in their callbacks and
\* both commit 1. One increment is lost, because validation looked only at
\* the keys the closures wrote and never at the counter.
NoLostUpdate ==
  \* The counter equals the number of (owner, attempt) pairs that committed.
  ctr = Cardinality({p \in Owners \X Attempts : committed[p[1]][p[2]]})

\* ATTEMPTS ARE ISOLATED. Every callback that ran reported the outcome of
\* its own attempt: a re-run never runs a previous attempt's callbacks.
\* Lean: attempts_isolated.
\* Example ruled out: attempt 1 conflicts and attempt 2 commits; attempt 1's
\* on_commit, still registered, runs with attempt 2's outcome, so the caller
\* acts twice on one commit, once with values the failed attempt computed.
AttemptIsolation == \A r \in ranFor : r[2] = r[3]

\* ON THE COMMITTING THREAD (D53). Every outcome callback ran on the thread
\* that holds the commit's queue (its poll, or its drop), on the owner's
\* own thread (a blocking commit, a commit_nowait that was done when it
\* returned, or an abort the owner chose), or on the closing thread for a
\* transaction close aborted; never on a committer. Example ruled out: the
\* leader that synced a group running a member's on_commit on its own
\* thread while the member's thread is busy. Lean: Callbacks.lean,
\* delivered_on_queue_thread.
OnCommittingThread == \A r \in runBy : r[2] # "committer"

\* on_commit runs only once the commit is durable, at Immediate.
\* Example ruled out: on_commit tells the customer the order is placed, the
\* machine loses power before the fsync, and after the restart the order is
\* gone. The program needs this because Immediate durability promises that a
\* reported commit survives a crash.
CommitAfterDurable ==
  \* At Immediate durability,
  Durability = "Immediate" =>
    \* an owner whose current attempt's on_commit ran has a commit that the log sync already covers.
    \A x \in Owners : att[x] > 0 /\ ranC[x][att[x]] > 0 => durable >= cseq[x]

\* RESOLVED AT DELIVERY, AFTER LANDING. A ticket's outcome is decided only
\* from a commit group that holds it and has landed: a commit owed an fsync
\* is not even known to its ticket before the fsync.
\* Example ruled out: the ticket of a commit at Immediate is decided when the
\* commit is written; a caller that blocks on the ticket's decision sees
\* "committed", the machine loses power before the fsync, and the commit is
\* gone.
ResolvedAfterLanding ==
  \* For every owner whose ticket has an outcome:
  \A x \in Owners : ps[x] \in {"decided", "delivering", "ready"} =>
    \* the pipeline decided it, and its group has landed.
    gs[x] = "decided" /\ Landed(x)

\* A PANIC IN BEFORE_COMMIT ABORTS. The attempt never commits and never runs
\* on_commit. Lean: panic_aborts.
\* Example ruled out: a before_commit callback panics halfway through its
\* writes and the half-written transaction commits anyway.
PanicAborts ==
  \* For every owner and attempt:
  \A x \in Owners, a \in Attempts :
    \* one whose before_commit panicked did not commit, and its on_commit never ran.
    panicked[x][a] => ~committed[x][a] /\ ranC[x][a] = 0

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* Liveness.

\* Everything settles: every transact call returns, and every outcome has
\* run. Example ruled out: an outcome is decided but no path ever delivers
\* it, so its owner waits for its ticket for ever. Unlike the invariants,
\* which look at one state at a time, this is a promise about whole runs: TLC
\* checks that every run allowed by Fairness reaches a settled state.
