---- MODULE LockTable ----
\* ===========================================================================
\* THE STORY
\* ===========================================================================
\* A pessimistic transaction in regolith locks a key before it reads or
\* writes it, so two transactions can never change one key at the same time.
\* The locks live in a table: one small lock per key that is locked or waited
\* for right now (src/transaction/lock_table.rs). Nothing in it is a mutex:
\* taking a lock is one compare-and-swap that writes the taker's name into
\* the lock's state word (src/sync/owned_lock.rs).
\*
\* A transaction that finds the lock taken can do two things:
\*   - try_get_for_update returns at once with a "wait" (a LockWait). The
\*     transaction's thread carries on with other work. When the lock may be
\*     free, a note is dropped into that thread's own inbox (its IoQueue),
\*     and the wait becomes ready the next time the thread looks at its
\*     inbox. Then it calls again;
\*   - get_for_update goes to sleep (the thread is parked) and is woken when
\*     the lock may be free. It gives up after a timeout.
\* Both keep the transaction's place in the lock's waiting line.
\*
\* Who gets a lock that was just released? Whoever asks first, even if others
\* are waiting in line ("barging"): a running thread never waits for a
\* sleeping one. To stop a waiter starving, each time the front waiter is
\* told "try now" and finds the lock gone again, it counts one loss. At
\* Bound losses (MAX_BYPASS in the code) it is "owed": nobody may barge any
\* more, and the next release hands the lock straight to it.
\*
\* Tiny example. Three transactions, one key, Bound = 1.
\*   1 takes the lock. 2 asks, finds it taken, and joins the line.
\*   1 releases; 2 gets a note "try now". Before 2's thread reads the note,
\*   3 asks and takes the free lock (barging).
\*   2 tries, loses: one loss, which is the bound, so 2 is owed.
\*   3 releases: the lock goes straight to 2. Nobody could barge in between.
\*
\* A commit made with commit_nowait is written first and becomes visible
\* later, when it "lands" (src/transaction/nowait.rs). Its locks are
\* released by the thread that lands it, at that moment. Not earlier, or the
\* next holder would read the key without the commit in it. Not later, at
\* the moment the committer's own thread hears about the outcome, or
\* everybody would wait for that thread to look at its inbox.
\*
\* What can go wrong, and what this model checks cannot happen:
\*   - two transactions hold one key (MutualExclusion), also when the key's
\*     lock is taken out of the table while somebody is about to use it
\*     (TableSound);
\*   - the lock is free, somebody waits, and nobody tells them
\*     (NoStrandedFront); or somebody is told and the note never reaches
\*     them (WokenIsTold);
\*   - a waiter loses more than Bound races (BoundedBypass);
\*   - a waiter's note lands in another thread's inbox, or its wait is
\*     completed by another thread (OwnQueue);
\*   - somebody takes the key while a commit to it is written but not yet
\*     visible (IsolationAtLanding), or a commit keeps its lock after it
\*     landed (HeldOnlyWhileNeeded);
\*   - and, over whole runs: everybody who asks is served or gives up
\*     (Served), even if a committer never looks at its inbox.
\*
\* PROVED FOR EVERY SIZE in Lean, proofs/lean/Regolith/LockTable.lean.
\*
\* WHAT IS MODELLED, and the code each piece mirrors:
\*   cur, uses     the table's one entry for the key and its use count:
\*                 LockTable::keys and KeyLock::uses, lock_table.rs
\*   holder        the name in the lock's state word: OwnedLock, owned_lock.rs
\*   fifo, nudged, the lock's waiting line and its "try now" marks: WaitQueue,
\*   owed, lost    Waiter and Contend in src/sync (queue.rs, waiter.rs,
\*                 contend.rs)
\*   note          the completion a call recorded for itself before it
\*                 polled: PendingLock::note and sleep_here, lock_table.rs
\*   inbox, ready  a thread's IoQueue inbox and the LockWait's slot:
\*                 QueueShared::deliver and WaitSlot, src/engine/io/shared.rs
\*   pending       commits written and not yet visible: a slot of the
\*                 commit ring and the list of those to tell when it lands,
\*                 Descriptor::listen, src/engine/commit/descriptor.rs
\*
\* WHAT THE MODEL LEAVES OUT, and why that loses nothing.
\*   - One key. Each key has its own lock, and no step touches two.
\*   - One call per transaction at a time. A second thread of the same
\*     transaction reads its own name in the state word and returns, or
\*     shares the transaction's one wait for the key: LockTableCalls.tla
\*     checks two calls of one transaction, one wait between them, and a
\*     wake that falls inside one call's poll.
\*   - Close. It wakes every waiter and refuses new ones; the loom model
\*     no_lock_wait_outlives_close checks it against the real types.
\*   - The drain role (which thread runs a pass over the waiting line). A
\*     pass is one step here; Sync.tla models the role step by step.
\*   - Memory ordering is loom's (tests/loom_locks.rs).
\*
\* CONFIGURATIONS (MC_LockTable_*.cfg).
\*   Green_Try       three transactions that never wait, Bound 1.
\*   Green_Bound2    the same with Bound 2: the count reaches 2.
\*   Green_Blocking  one sleeps for the lock and may time out.
\*   Green_Nowait    commits land later; locks go at the landing.
\*   Green_Cancel    waiters may give up at any time.
\*   Green_Table     two entry names, so a retired entry is told apart.
\*   Green_Mixed     a sleeper, a commit_nowait and a give-up at once:
\*                   every invariant, five lock calls.
\*   Green_MixedLive the same with four lock calls: everybody is served.
\*   Green_Four      four transactions, three in line: every invariant.
\*   Red_RetireNoCas, Red_NoRecheck, Red_ReleaseNoWake, Red_NoteAfterPoll,
\*   Red_CancelNoPassOn, Red_UnboundedBarging, Red_WrongQueue,
\*   Red_CompleteOnWaker, Red_ReleaseAtWrite, Red_ReleaseAtDelivery: one
\*   planted bug each; the comment in each file tells its story.

\* Numbers, lists and set sizes come from these standard modules.
EXTENDS Naturals, Sequences, FiniteSets

\* The things a configuration chooses.
CONSTANTS
  \* The transactions: positive numbers. Each runs on its own thread, and
  \* that thread's inbox (IoQueue) has the same number.
  Txns,
  \* Names for table entries (one KeyLock allocation each). An entry's name
  \* can be used again once nobody refers to it, like freed memory.
  Entries,
  \* The transactions that sleep for a lock (get_for_update, put, delete,
  \* merge). The others use try_get_for_update and their own inbox.
  Blocking,
  \* The transactions that commit with commit_nowait.
  Nowait,
  \* The transactions that may give a wait up: they end without the lock,
  \* or their sleep times out.
  MayCancel,
  \* MAX_BYPASS: how many races a waiter may lose before it is owed.
  Bound,
  \* How many lock calls may start in a whole run, so the run is finite.
  Takes,
  \* The transactions whose wait must end, checked over whole runs.
  Watched,
  \* "none" for the real code, or the name of one planted bug.
  Mutant

\* The number 0 stands for "nobody" and "no entry".
None == 0
\* The number 0 also stands for "a thread other than the waiter's own".
NotOwn == 0
\* Some other transaction (only the WrongQueue bug uses it).
Other(t) == CHOOSE o \in Txns : o # t

\* Transactions and entries are numbered from 1, so 0 can mean "none".
ASSUME Txns \subseteq Nat \ {0} /\ Entries \subseteq Nat \ {0}
\* The special groups of transactions are made of transactions.
ASSUME Blocking \subseteq Txns /\ Nowait \subseteq Txns
\* So are the ones that may give up and the ones we watch.
ASSUME MayCancel \subseteq Txns /\ Watched \subseteq Txns
\* The bound is at least 1, and the budget is a number.
ASSUME Bound \in Nat \ {0} /\ Takes \in Nat
\* The bug names this model knows.
ASSUME Mutant \in {"none", "RetireNoCas", "NoRecheck", "ReleaseNoWake",
                   "NoteAfterPoll", "CancelNoPassOn", "UnboundedBarging",
                   "WrongQueue", "CompleteOnWaker", "ReleaseAtWrite",
                   "ReleaseAtDelivery"}

\* The state that changes from step to step.
VARIABLES
  \* The entry the table holds for the key, or None when the key has none
  \* (LockTable::keys).
  cur,
  \* [Entries -> Nat]: how many transactions use each entry: its holder,
  \* each waiter, each call between its lookup and its outcome
  \* (KeyLock::uses).
  uses,
  \* [Entries -> Txns \cup {None}]: the name in each entry's state word: who
  \* holds the lock (OwnedLock::holder).
  holder,
  \* [Entries -> Seq(Txns)]: each entry's waiting line, oldest first.
  fifo,
  \* [Entries -> Txns \cup {None}]: the waiter that reached the bound and is
  \* owed the next release (the HANDOFF bit and the waiter's owed mark).
  owed,
  \* [Txns -> Entries \cup {None}]: the entry each transaction looked up and
  \* still refers to (its Arc<KeyLock>).
  pin,
  \* [Txns -> a step name]: where each transaction is in its lock call.
  pc,
  \* [Txns -> BOOLEAN]: a release asked this waiter to try again and it has
  \* not tried yet (the NUDGED bit of its waiter node).
  nudged,
  \* [Txns -> Nat]: races this waiter lost since it joined the line
  \* (Contend::bypass).
  lost,
  \* [Txns -> BOOLEAN]: the call recorded how it is to be told, and nobody
  \* has told it yet (a note in PendingLock's Wakeup).
  note,
  \* [Txns -> SUBSET Txns]: each thread's inbox: the waits whose "the lock
  \* may be free" note was pushed there and not taken in yet.
  inbox,
  \* [Txns -> BOOLEAN]: the LockWait a transaction was handed is ready.
  ready,
  \* [Txns -> Txns \cup {NotOwn}]: ghost, the thread that made it ready.
  readyBy,
  \* [Txns -> BOOLEAN]: a sleeping transaction's thread was unparked.
  unparked,
  \* The transactions whose commit is written and not yet visible.
  pending,
  \* The transactions whose commit outcome their own thread has not heard.
  undelivered,
  \* How many more lock calls may start.
  budget

\* Every variable, so a step that changes none of them is a stutter.
vars == <<cur, uses, holder, fifo, owed, pin, pc, nudged, lost, note, inbox,
          ready, readyBy, unparked, pending, undelivered, budget>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* SMALL HELPERS

\* Transaction t holds the key, through whichever entry.
Holds(t) == \E e \in Entries : holder[e] = t
\* A caller may take entry e right now: nobody holds it and nobody is owed.
Free(e) == holder[e] = None /\ owed[e] = None
\* Transaction t uses entry e: it refers to it and has not given its use
\* back yet (at "retire" the use is already given back).
Using(t, e) == pin[t] = e /\ pc[t] # "retire"
\* The line q without transaction t.
Without(q, t) == SelectSeq(q, LAMBDA x : x # t)
\* The step names in which a transaction is asking for the lock.
Asking == {"busy", "noted", "enqueue", "parking", "lateNote", "waiting",
           "renoted"}

\* A wake reaches waiter w only if w has returned from its call with a note
\* recorded: then the note is delivered. A waiter still inside its call
\* sees the nudge or the handoff itself when it looks.
Go(w) == w # None /\ pc[w] = "waiting" /\ note[w]
\* The notes after waking w: w's note is used up.
NoteT(w) == IF Go(w) THEN [note EXCEPT ![w] = FALSE] ELSE note
\* The unparked flags after waking w: a sleeper's thread is unparked.
UnparkedT(w) == IF Go(w) /\ w \in Blocking
                \* A sleeper that is woken: its flag goes up. Anybody else: no flag changes.
                THEN [unparked EXCEPT ![w] = TRUE] ELSE unparked
\* The inboxes after waking w: the note goes into w's OWN inbox. The
\* WrongQueue bug puts it into another thread's; the CompleteOnWaker bug
\* skips the inbox altogether.
InboxT(w) == IF Go(w) /\ w \notin Blocking /\ Mutant # "CompleteOnWaker"
             \* A polling waiter that is woken: w's name is added to its own inbox (in the
             \* WrongQueue bug, to the other thread's).
             THEN [inbox EXCEPT ![IF Mutant = "WrongQueue" THEN Other(w) ELSE w]
                     = @ \cup {w}]
             \* Nobody is woken that way: every inbox stays as it is.
             ELSE inbox
\* The ready flags after waking w: nothing, in the real code (only w's own
\* poll makes its wait ready). The CompleteOnWaker bug makes it ready here.
ReadyT(w) == IF Go(w) /\ w \notin Blocking /\ Mutant = "CompleteOnWaker"
             \* Only in the bug: w's wait is made ready by the waker. Otherwise no flag changes.
             THEN [ready EXCEPT ![w] = TRUE] ELSE ready
\* Who made it ready: in the bug, a thread that is not w's own.
ReadyByT(w) == IF Go(w) /\ w \notin Blocking /\ Mutant = "CompleteOnWaker"
               \* Only in the bug: the record says a thread that is not w's own did it.
               THEN [readyBy EXCEPT ![w] = NotOwn] ELSE readyBy
\* The nudge marks after nudging w.
NudgedT(w) == IF w # None THEN [nudged EXCEPT ![w] = TRUE] ELSE nudged

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* HOW IT STARTS

\* Nothing is locked, nobody waits, no entry is in the table.
Init ==
  \* The table has no entry for the key.
  /\ cur = None
  \* No entry is used.
  /\ uses = [e \in Entries |-> 0]
  \* No entry is held.
  /\ holder = [e \in Entries |-> None]
  \* No entry has a waiting line.
  /\ fifo = [e \in Entries |-> <<>>]
  \* Nobody is owed.
  /\ owed = [e \in Entries |-> None]
  \* No transaction refers to an entry.
  /\ pin = [t \in Txns |-> None]
  \* Every transaction is idle.
  /\ pc = [t \in Txns |-> "idle"]
  \* Nobody was nudged.
  /\ nudged = [t \in Txns |-> FALSE]
  \* Nobody lost a race.
  /\ lost = [t \in Txns |-> 0]
  \* Nobody recorded a note.
  /\ note = [t \in Txns |-> FALSE]
  \* Every inbox is empty.
  /\ inbox = [t \in Txns |-> {}]
  \* No wait is ready.
  /\ ready = [t \in Txns |-> FALSE]
  \* So nobody made one ready; each slot starts as its owner's.
  /\ readyBy = [t \in Txns |-> t]
  \* No thread was unparked.
  /\ unparked = [t \in Txns |-> FALSE]
  \* No commit is waiting to become visible.
  /\ pending = {}
  \* No commit outcome is waiting to be heard.
  /\ undelivered = {}
  \* The whole budget of lock calls is left.
  /\ budget = Takes

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TAKING THE LOCK

\* A transaction starts a lock call: it looks the key up in the table and
\* takes a use of its entry, or makes the entry if the key has none
\* (LockTable::pin).
Lookup(t) ==
  \* It is not in a call already.
  /\ pc[t] = "idle"
  \* The run has a call left.
  /\ budget > 0
  \* Its last commit is behind it: landed, and heard by its own thread.
  /\ t \notin pending /\ t \notin undelivered
  \* One call fewer is left.
  /\ budget' = budget - 1
  \* It now tries the fast path.
  /\ pc' = [pc EXCEPT ![t] = "pinned"]
  \* Either the key has an entry ...
  /\ IF cur # None
       \* ... and then:
       THEN
            \* the transaction refers to it,
            /\ pin' = [pin EXCEPT ![t] = cur]
            \* and takes one more use of it.
            /\ uses' = [uses EXCEPT ![cur] = @ + 1]
            \* The table and the lock itself do not change.
            /\ UNCHANGED <<cur, holder, fifo, owed>>
       \* ... or it has none, and a new entry is made.
       ELSE
            \* The names nobody refers to are free:
            LET free == {e \in Entries : \A u \in Txns : pin[u] # e}
                \* the lowest of them is the new entry's name.
                e == CHOOSE x \in free : \A y \in free : x <= y
            \* With that name:
            IN
                \* (there must be a free name)
                /\ free # {}
                \* The table now holds the new entry for the key.
                /\ cur' = e
                \* The transaction refers to it,
                /\ pin' = [pin EXCEPT ![t] = e]
                \* and is its one user (KeyLock::new starts at 1).
                /\ uses' = [uses EXCEPT ![e] = 1]
                \* A new lock is held by nobody,
                /\ holder' = [holder EXCEPT ![e] = None]
                \* has nobody waiting,
                /\ fifo' = [fifo EXCEPT ![e] = <<>>]
                \* and owes nobody.
                /\ owed' = [owed EXCEPT ![e] = None]
  \* Nothing else changes.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<nudged, lost, note, inbox, ready, readyBy, unparked, pending,
                 undelivered>>

\* The fast path: one compare-and-swap that takes a free lock and writes
\* the taker's name (OwnedLock::try_lock). It works even if others wait.

\* Before it polls, the call records how it is to be told: a completion for
\* its inbox, or its thread to unpark (PendingLock::note, sleep_here). The

\* The transaction joins the back of the line, and the line is looked at

\* release comes after it (OwnedLock::unlock in release_locks).
Unlock(t) ==
  \* It holds the lock and does not use commit_nowait.
  /\ pc[t] = "holding" /\ t \notin Nowait
  \* The name leaves the state word.

\* commit_nowait: the commit is decided and written to the log, and the
\* call returns. It is not visible yet, and the lock stays held. The
\* ReleaseAtWrite bug lets the lock go here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* GIVING THE ENTRY BACK

\* What a transaction's own marks are once its call is over.
Forget(f, t, v) == [f EXCEPT ![t] = v]

\* The transaction gives its use of the entry back (LockTable::unpin, the
\* decrement). If that was the last use, it goes on to retire the entry.
Unpin(t) ==
  \* It is done with the lock.
  /\ pc[t] = "unpin"
  \* One use fewer.
  /\ uses' = [uses EXCEPT ![pin[t]] = @ - 1]
  \* If it was the last one ...
  /\ IF uses[pin[t]] = 1
       \* ... the entry may have to go:
       THEN
            \* the transaction tries to retire the entry next,
            /\ pc' = [pc EXCEPT ![t] = "retire"]
            \* still holding its reference to it.
            /\ UNCHANGED pin
       \* ... otherwise others still use the entry:
       ELSE
            \* the transaction is finished with it,
            /\ pc' = [pc EXCEPT ![t] = "idle"]
            \* and refers to nothing.
            /\ pin' = [pin EXCEPT ![t] = None]
  \* Its marks from this call are cleared.
  /\ nudged' = Forget(nudged, t, FALSE)
  \* Its count starts over.
  /\ lost' = Forget(lost, t, 0)
  \* Its note is gone.
  /\ note' = Forget(note, t, FALSE)
  \* Its wait is gone.
  /\ ready' = Forget(ready, t, FALSE)
  \* Its unpark is gone.
  /\ unparked' = Forget(unparked, t, FALSE)
  \* Nothing else changes.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<cur, holder, fifo, owed, inbox, readyBy, pending, undelivered,
                 budget>>

\* The transaction that gave back the last use takes the entry out of the
\* table, but only if nobody took a use in the meantime: the check and the
\* retirement are one compare-and-swap on the count, made inside the map's
\* removal of exactly this entry (KeyLock::retire in remove_if). The
\* RetireNoCas bug retires without looking.
TryRetire(t) ==
  \* It gave back the last use.
  /\ pc[t] = "retire"
  \* If the entry is still unused (or in the bug, whatever its count) ...
  /\ IF uses[pin[t]] = 0 \/ Mutant = "RetireNoCas"
       \* ... the entry is retired:
       THEN
            \* the table lets go of it, if it is still the key's entry.
            cur' = IF cur = pin[t] THEN None ELSE cur
       \* ... otherwise somebody uses it:
       ELSE
            \* it stays in the table.
            UNCHANGED cur
  \* The transaction refers to nothing now,
  /\ pin' = [pin EXCEPT ![t] = None]
  \* and its call is over.
  /\ pc' = [pc EXCEPT ![t] = "idle"]
  \* Nothing else changes.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<uses, holder, fifo, owed, nudged, lost, note, inbox, ready,
                 readyBy, unparked, pending, undelivered, budget>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* ALL THE STEPS

\* One step of the system is one step of one transaction or one thread.
Next ==
  \* A transaction starts a lock call.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : Lookup(t)
  \* It tries the fast path.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : TryFast(t)
  \* It records how it is to be told.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : Note(t)
  \* It tries once more.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : TryAgain(t)
  \* It joins the line.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : Enqueue(t)
  \* It looks at its place in the line.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : Park(t)
  \* The planted bug's late note.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : LateNote(t)
  \* A thread looks at its inbox.
  \/ \E q \in Txns : PollQueue(q)
  \* A told transaction calls again.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : Rerun(t)
  \* Its call polls its place in the line.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : PollQueued(t)
  \* A waiter gives up.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : Cancel(t)
  \* A holder releases.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : Unlock(t)
  \* A holder commits with commit_nowait.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : Write(t)
  \* A written commit lands.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : Land(t)
  \* The lander releases the commit's lock.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : LanderRelease(t)
  \* A committer's thread hears its outcome.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : Deliver(t)
  \* A releaser looks at the line.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : Drain(t)
  \* A transaction gives its use of the entry back.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : Unpin(t)
  \* The last user retires the entry.
  \/ \E t \in Txns : TryRetire(t)

\* The whole behaviour: start, then steps, and every transaction keeps
\* going while it can. Three things are never forced: starting a new call,
\* giving up, and a committer hearing its own outcome.
Spec ==
  \* Start.
  /\ Init
  \* Step.
  /\ [][Next]_vars
  \* Each transaction keeps going:

       \* the note,
       /\ WF_vars(Note(t))

       \* joining the line,

       \* the bug's late note,
       /\ WF_vars(LateNote(t))
       \* looking at its inbox,

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* WHAT MUST ALWAYS HOLD

\* Every variable holds the kind of value it should.
TypeOK ==
  \* The table holds an entry or none.
  /\ cur \in Entries \cup {None}
  \* Use counts are numbers.
  /\ uses \in [Entries -> Nat]
  \* A holder is a transaction or nobody.
  /\ holder \in [Entries -> Txns \cup {None}]
  \* A waiting line is a list of transactions.
  /\ fifo \in [Entries -> Seq(Txns)]
  \* The owed waiter is a transaction or nobody.
  /\ owed \in [Entries -> Txns \cup {None}]
  \* A transaction refers to an entry or none.
  /\ pin \in [Txns -> Entries \cup {None}]
  \* Each transaction is at a known step.
  /\ pc \in [Txns -> {"idle", "pinned", "busy", "noted", "enqueue", "parking",
                      "lateNote", "waiting", "renoted", "holding", "written",
                      "landed", "kept", "drain", "unpin", "retire"}]
  \* Nudge marks are yes or no.
  /\ nudged \in [Txns -> BOOLEAN]
  \* Loss counts are numbers.
  /\ lost \in [Txns -> Nat]
  \* Notes are there or not.
  /\ note \in [Txns -> BOOLEAN]
  \* An inbox holds waits, named by their transaction.
  /\ inbox \in [Txns -> SUBSET Txns]
  \* A wait is ready or not.
  /\ ready \in [Txns -> BOOLEAN]
  \* It was made ready by a thread, or by "not its own".
  /\ readyBy \in [Txns -> Txns \cup {NotOwn}]
  \* A thread was unparked or not.
  /\ unparked \in [Txns -> BOOLEAN]
  \* Pending commits are transactions.
  /\ pending \subseteq Txns
  \* So are the unheard outcomes.
  /\ undelivered \subseteq Txns
  \* The budget never goes above its start.
  /\ budget \in 0..Takes

\* RULE 1, mutual exclusion. At most one transaction holds the key. Without
\* it, two transactions could both read a counter at 5 and both write 6.
MutualExclusion ==
  \* Any two transactions that hold the key are the same one.
  \A t, u \in Txns : (Holds(t) /\ Holds(u)) => t = u

\* RULE 1, the table's half. An entry that left the table is used by
\* nobody: no holder, no waiter, no call about to use it. And the entry in
\* the table counts its users exactly. Without it, one transaction could
\* take the old entry's lock while another takes the new entry's.
TableSound ==
  \* For every entry name:
  \A e \in Entries :
    \* is it the entry the table holds for the key?
    IF e = cur
      \* Yes: it is the entry in the table.
      THEN
           \* Its count is exactly the number of transactions using it.
           uses[e] = Cardinality({t \in Txns : Using(t, e)})
      \* No: it is an entry out of the table, which
      ELSE
           \* has no holder,
           /\ holder[e] = None
           \* no waiting line,
           /\ fifo[e] = <<>>
           \* and no user.
           /\ \A t \in Txns : ~Using(t, e)

\* RULE 2, no lost wake-up, first half. If the lock is free, nobody is
\* owed, somebody waits and no releaser is about to look at the line, then
\* the front waiter has been told to try. Without it, a free lock and a
\* waiter that sleeps forever would sit side by side.
NoStrandedFront ==
  \* For every entry:
  \A e \in Entries :
    \* if it is free and nobody is owed,
    (/\ Free(e)
     \* somebody waits,
     /\ fifo[e] # <<>>
     \* and no releaser still owes the line a look,
     /\ ~\E t \in Txns : pin[t] = e /\ pc[t] = "drain")
    \* then its front waiter carries the "try again" mark.
    => nudged[Head(fifo[e])]

\* A waiting transaction has been told: a sleeper's thread was unparked; a
\* polling one has the note in its own inbox, or its wait is ready already.
Told(t) == IF t \in Blocking THEN unparked[t] ELSE (t \in inbox[t] \/ ready[t])

\* RULE 2, second half. A transaction that waits outside any call, and was
\* nudged or handed the lock, has been told. Without it, the mark would be
\* set on a waiter that never looks again: its note fell between two steps.
WokenIsTold ==
  \* For every transaction waiting outside a call,
  \A t \in Txns :
    \* that was nudged or holds the lock by handoff:
    (pc[t] = "waiting" /\ (nudged[t] \/ holder[pin[t]] = t))
    \* it was told.
    => Told(t)

\* RULE 3, bounded bypass. No waiter loses more than Bound races. Without
\* it, two busy transactions could pass the lock back and forth for ever
\* while a third starves.
BoundedBypass ==
  \* Every loss count is within the bound.
  \A t \in Txns : lost[t] <= Bound

\* RULE 4, delivery on the waiter's own queue. A note is only ever in the
\* inbox of the transaction whose wait it completes, and a wait is made
\* ready only by its own thread. Without it, thread 2's poll would finish
\* thread 1's wait, and thread 1, which never polls for it, would be
\* resumed on the wrong thread or not at all.
OwnQueue ==
  \* Every inbox holds only its own transaction's waits,
  /\ \A q \in Txns : inbox[q] \subseteq {q}
  \* and a ready wait was made ready by its own thread.
  /\ \A t \in Txns : ready[t] => readyBy[t] = t

\* RULE 5, release at landing keeps isolation. While a commit is written
\* and not yet visible, nobody else holds the key. Without it, the next
\* holder would read the key as it was before the commit, add 1, and
\* overwrite the commit: a lost update.
IsolationAtLanding ==
  \* For every commit not yet visible, every other transaction
  \A t \in pending : \A u \in Txns \ {t} :
    \* does not hold the key.
    ~Holds(u)

\* RULE 5, the other side: the lock does not outlive the landing. A
\* transaction holds the key only while it uses it, while its commit has
\* not landed, or while it waits with the lock just handed to it. Without
\* it, every other transaction would wait until the committer's thread
\* gets round to looking at its inbox.
HeldOnlyWhileNeeded ==
  \* For every transaction:
  \A t \in Txns :
    \* if it holds the key, it is at one of these steps.
    Holds(t) => pc[t] \in {"holding", "written", "landed", "parking",
                           "waiting", "renoted"}

\* Over whole runs: a watched transaction that asks for the lock stops
\* asking: it gets the lock, or gives up. Nothing here depends on a
\* committer hearing its own outcome, since that step is never forced.
Served ==
  \* For every watched transaction, asking leads to not asking.
  \A t \in Watched : (pc[t] \in Asking) ~> (pc[t] \notin Asking)
