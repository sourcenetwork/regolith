---- MODULE EnvFiles ----
\* ===========================================================================
\* THE STORY
\* ===========================================================================
\* regolith reads and writes its files through an Env. Two Envs keep files
\* in memory (MemEnv, and the OPFS mirror in a browser tab), and the real
\* one reads files from the disk. Many threads read at once: get, scans,
\* compaction. The rule every Env must keep:
\*
\*     a read sees the bytes of every write that finished before it began,
\*     at the offset it asked for.
\*
\* PART 1, the disk: a shared cursor. An open file has one "cursor"
\* position. Reading with seek-then-read is two steps on that one cursor:
\* reader A seeks to 0, reader B seeks to 100, reader A reads... at 100. A
\* got B's bytes. A positional read (pread, StdReadFile in
\* src/env/std_env.rs) names its offset in the one call, so there is no
\* shared position to race on.
\*
\* PART 2, a file in memory (MemFile, src/env/mem_file.rs). The file is a
\* buffer with spare room and a published length L; readers read below L
\* with no lock. An append that fits writes ABOVE L, under a WRITER flag it
\* took with a compare-and-swap (CAS), and then publishes L+n with a second
\* CAS. Anything else (no room, an overwrite, two appends at once) builds a
\* NEW buffer from the old one's first L bytes plus its own, FREEZES the old
\* buffer with a CAS so no append can publish there any more, and swaps the
\* new buffer in with a CAS on the file's pointer.
\*
\* Tiny example of why the freeze matters. Writer A holds WRITER on buffer
\* E and is copying its record above L. Writer B gives up on E (it is busy)
\* and copies E's first L bytes into E2, plus its own record, and swaps E2
\* in. If B did not freeze E, A now publishes on E, an old buffer nobody
\* reads any more: A's append "finished", but no later read can see it.
\* With the freeze, A's publishing CAS fails, and A appends again on E2.
\*
\* PART 3, a table renamed while its handles reopen it. Under
\* max_open_files a table's file is closed while it is not read, and
\* reopened by name (PathEntry::reopen, src/env/open_file_limit/mod.rs).
\* A compaction that removes a table some reader still holds renames the
\* file aside instead (Shared::relocate): it first records both names (the
\* old one as "previous"), then asks the Env to rename, then records only
\* the new one. A reopen loads the names and tries "previous", then
\* "current". Two things must hold for that to always find the file:
\*   - the Env's rename puts the file under the new name BEFORE it takes it
\*     from the old one (MemEnv::rename, and the OPFS mirror and pool), so
\*     at every instant one of the two names holds it;
\*   - a reopen that loaded the names before the whole move ran (it knows
\*     only the old name, and the file is already under the new one) loads
\*     the names again when its open finds nothing, and tries again.
\* Tiny example. Thread 1 loads the names: "A". Thread 2 moves the table
\* to "B" from start to end. Thread 1 opens "A": nothing there. It loads
\* the names again, sees "B", and opens "B".
\*
\* What this model checks cannot happen:
\*   - a disk read returns bytes from another offset (ReadsOwnBytes);
\*   - a memory read misses a write that finished before it began
\*     (ReadSeesFinished), or the current buffer misses one
\*     (CurrentHoldsFinished);
\*   - a record lands twice (AtMostOnce);
\*   - a reopen finds the file under none of its names while it is being
\*     renamed (OpenFindsFile).
\*
\* WHAT IS MODELLED, and the code each piece mirrors:
\*   cursor, pgot     the shared position of a seek-then-read file, and
\*                    what each disk reader got
\*   cur              MemFile::current, the buffer readers load
\*   buf, len         an Extent's bytes (published and pending) and its
\*                    published length (the LEN bits of Extent::state)
\*   wbit, frozen     the WRITER and FROZEN bits of Extent::state
\*   finished         the appends that returned
\*   wpc.. / rpc..    each writer's and reader's step and what it holds
\*   mph              how far the move has got (PathEntry::names and the
\*                    Env's map: which names hold the file)
\*   opc, over        each reopen's step, and which recorded names it loaded
\*
\* WHAT IS LEFT OUT, and why that loses nothing:
\*   - Byte counts: a record is one slot of a sequence; an append of n
\*     bytes is the same protocol with n slots.
\*   - Overwrites and shrinks: they always take the copy path, which is
\*     the path modelled here for appends too.
\*   - The spare capacity: when it runs out a writer takes the copy path;
\*     here a writer may take either path at any time, which covers it.
\*   - Memory ordering: the CAS steps are atomic here; the code's Acquire
\*     and Release make them so.
\*
\* CONFIGURATIONS (each GREEN must pass, each RED must break the one
\* invariant it names):
\*   MC_EnvFiles_Green               two disk readers, two appenders, one
\*                                   memory reader.
\*   MC_EnvFiles_Green_ThreeWriters  three appenders, so one publishes in
\*                                   place between another's build and a
\*                                   third's freeze.
\*   MC_EnvFiles_Red_SharedCursor    disk reads seek then read on one shared
\*                                   cursor: ReadsOwnBytes breaks.
\*   MC_EnvFiles_Red_NoFreeze        a copy swaps without freezing the old
\*                                   buffer: CurrentHoldsFinished breaks.
\*   MC_EnvFiles_Red_StaleFrozen     a copy skips its freeze because the
\*                                   buffer is frozen NOW, though it was not
\*                                   at its build: CurrentHoldsFinished
\*                                   breaks.
\*   MC_EnvFiles_Green_Rename        two reopens racing one move. Every rule
\*                                   holds.
\*   MC_EnvFiles_Red_RemoveFirst     the Env's rename takes the old name
\*                                   before it adds the new one: OpenFindsFile
\*                                   breaks.
\*   MC_EnvFiles_Red_NoReload        a reopen that found nothing gives up
\*                                   without loading the names again:
\*                                   OpenFindsFile breaks.
\*
\* Lean, proofs/lean/Regolith/EnvFiles.lean, proves the first four rules
\* for every number of readers, writers and steps;
\* proofs/lean/Regolith/EnvFilesRename.lean proves OpenFindsFile for every
\* number of reopens and every order of steps.

\* We use numbers, sequences and finite sets.

\* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* Part 1: disk reads.
\* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\* A positional read: one call names the offset and returns its bytes
\* (pread). The bug SharedCursor never takes this step.
PRead(r) ==
  \* The real code.
  /\ Mutant # "SharedCursor"
  \* The reader has not read.
  /\ ppc[r] = "start"
  \* It gets the bytes at its own offset, in one step.
  /\ pgot' = [pgot EXCEPT ![r] = Data(At[r])]
  \* The reader is done.
  /\ ppc' = [ppc EXCEPT ![r] = "done"]
  \* Nothing else changes.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<cursor, memVars>>

\* Bug SharedCursor, step 1: move the file's one cursor to my offset.
Seek(r) ==
  \* Only with the bug.
  /\ Mutant = "SharedCursor"
  \* The reader has not read.
  /\ ppc[r] = "start"
  \* The shared cursor goes to its offset.
  /\ cursor' = At[r]
  \* It goes on to read at the cursor.
  /\ ppc' = [ppc EXCEPT ![r] = "sought"]
  \* Nothing else changes.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<pgot, memVars>>

\* Bug SharedCursor, step 2: read at the cursor, wherever it is now.
ReadAtCursor(r) ==
  \* The reader sought.
  /\ ppc[r] = "sought"
  \* It gets the bytes at the cursor, which another reader may have moved.
  /\ pgot' = [pgot EXCEPT ![r] = Data(cursor)]
  \* The reader is done.
  /\ ppc' = [ppc EXCEPT ![r] = "done"]
  \* Nothing else changes.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<cursor, memVars>>

\* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* Part 2: the in-memory file.
\* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\* An append in place, step 1: take WRITER on the current buffer with a CAS
\* that needs no WRITER and no FROZEN (MemFile::in_place).
InPlaceClaim(w) ==
  \* The writer is about to append.
  /\ wpc[w] = "start"
  \* The current buffer is free to append to.
  /\ ~wbit[cur]
  \* ... and is not frozen.
  /\ ~frozen[cur]
  \* The CAS sets WRITER.
  /\ wbit' = [wbit EXCEPT ![cur] = TRUE]
  \* The writer remembers the buffer and its length.
  /\ wext' = [wext EXCEPT ![w] = cur]
  \* It remembers the published length it saw.
  /\ wlen' = [wlen EXCEPT ![w] = len[cur]]
  \* It goes on to write above that length.
  /\ wpc' = [wpc EXCEPT ![w] = "claimed"]
  \* Nothing else changes.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<diskVars, cur, buf, len, frozen, nextExt, finished, wsaw, wnew,
                 \* (continued: the readers' variables)
                 rpc, rfin, rext, rlen, rgot>>

\* An append in place, step 2: write the record just above the published
\* length. No reader reads there.
InPlaceWrite(w) ==
  \* The writer holds WRITER.
  /\ wpc[w] = "claimed"
  \* Its record goes right after the published records.
  /\ buf' = [buf EXCEPT ![wext[w]] = SubSeq(buf[wext[w]], 1, wlen[w]) \o <<w>>]
  \* It goes on to publish.
  /\ wpc' = [wpc EXCEPT ![w] = "written"]
  \* Nothing else changes.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<diskVars, cur, len, wbit, frozen, nextExt, finished, wext, wlen,

                 wsaw, wnew, rpc, rfin, rext, rlen, rgot>>

\* An append in place, step 3: publish the new length with a CAS that
\* clears WRITER. It fails if a copier froze the buffer meanwhile; then the
\* writer appends again from the start.
InPlacePublish(w) ==
  \* The writer wrote its record.
  /\ wpc[w] = "written"
  \* Call the writer's buffer e.
  /\ LET e == wext[w] IN
       \* Not frozen: the CAS publishes, and the append has finished.
       IF ~frozen[e]
       \* The CAS wins: the length grows by its record ...
       THEN /\ len' = [len EXCEPT ![e] = wlen[w] + 1]
            \* ... the WRITER bit is released ...
            /\ wbit' = [wbit EXCEPT ![e] = FALSE]
            \* ... and the append has finished.
            /\ finished' = finished \cup {w}
            \* The writer is done.
            /\ wpc' = [wpc EXCEPT ![w] = "done"]
       \* Frozen: the CAS fails; the buffer is dead and the writer retries.
       ELSE /\ wpc' = [wpc EXCEPT ![w] = "start"]
            \* The length, the bit and the finished set stay.
            /\ UNCHANGED <<len, wbit, finished>>
  \* Nothing else changes.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<diskVars, cur, buf, frozen, nextExt, wext, wlen, wsaw, wnew,
                 \* (continued: the readers' variables)
                 rpc, rfin, rext, rlen, rgot>>

\* A copy, step 1: build a new buffer from the current one's published
\* records plus this writer's record (MemFile::copy).
CopyBuild(w) ==
  \* The writer is about to append, and a buffer number is left.
  /\ wpc[w] = "start"
  \* A new buffer number is left.
  /\ nextExt <= MaxExt
  \* The new buffer: the published records, then this one.
  /\ wnew' = [wnew EXCEPT ![w] = SubSeq(buf[cur], 1, len[cur]) \o <<w>>]
  \* The writer remembers the buffer and the state word it saw.
  /\ wext' = [wext EXCEPT ![w] = cur]
  \* It remembers the published length it saw.
  /\ wlen' = [wlen EXCEPT ![w] = len[cur]]
  \* It remembers the bits it saw: the word its freeze CAS will expect.
  /\ wsaw' = [wsaw EXCEPT ![w] = [bit |-> wbit[cur], frz |-> frozen[cur]]]
  \* It goes on to freeze the old buffer.
  /\ wpc' = [wpc EXCEPT ![w] = "built"]
  \* Nothing else changes.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<diskVars, cur, buf, len, wbit, frozen, nextExt, finished,
                 \* (continued: the readers' variables)
                 rpc, rfin, rext, rlen, rgot>>

\* A copy, step 2: freeze the old buffer with a CAS on the word it saw when
\* it built, so no append publishes there any more. If that word was already
\* frozen, the length it copied is final and there is nothing to do. The
\* choice is made from the word seen at build time, as the code makes it
\* (MemFile::copy tests the `state` it loaded first): a buffer someone else
\* froze AFTER the build may have published more records before that freeze.
\* The bug NoFreeze skips the freeze.
CopyFreeze(w) ==
  \* The writer built its new buffer.
  /\ wpc[w] = "built"
  \* Call the writer's buffer e.
  /\ LET e == wext[w] IN
       \* The bug NoFreeze, or a buffer frozen when it built: go straight to
       \* the swap. The bug StaleFrozen also goes straight on when the buffer

          \/ Mutant = "StaleFrozen" /\ frozen[e]
       \* ... then it skips the freeze and goes on to swap.
       THEN /\ wpc' = [wpc EXCEPT ![w] = "frozen"]
            \* No bit changes.
            /\ UNCHANGED frozen
       \* The word is still what it saw: the CAS sets FROZEN.
       ELSE IF len[e] = wlen[w] /\ wbit[e] = wsaw[w].bit /\ ~frozen[e]
            \* Its CAS wins: the old buffer is frozen ...
            THEN /\ frozen' = [frozen EXCEPT ![e] = TRUE]
                 \* ... and it goes on to swap.
                 /\ wpc' = [wpc EXCEPT ![w] = "frozen"]
            \* The word changed (an append published, or another copy froze
            \* it): start over.
            ELSE /\ wpc' = [wpc EXCEPT ![w] = "start"]
                 \* No bit changes.

\* A copy, step 3: swap the new buffer in with a CAS on the file's pointer.
\* It fails if another copy swapped first; then the writer starts over.
CopySwap(w) ==
  \* The old buffer is frozen (or the bug skipped it).
  /\ wpc[w] = "frozen"
  \* The pointer still names the old buffer: the CAS wins ...
  /\ IF cur = wext[w]
     \* Its CAS wins: readers now load the new buffer ...
     THEN /\ cur' = nextExt
          \* ... and the new buffer holds what the writer built, all published.
          /\ buf' = [buf EXCEPT ![nextExt] = wnew[w]]
          \* ... published to its full length ...

\* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* Part 3: a table renamed aside while its handles reopen it.
\* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\* The names the table's entry records (PathEntry::names), by how many
\* times the move has stored them: 0 before the move, 1 while the rename
\* runs (both names, the old as "previous"), 2 once it settled.
NamesAt(v) ==
  \* Before the move: only "A".
  IF v = 0 THEN [cur |-> "A", prev |-> "none"]
  \* During the rename: "B" now, and "A" as where it was.
  ELSE IF v = 1 THEN [cur |-> "B", prev |-> "A"]
  \* Settled: only "B".
  ELSE [cur |-> "B", prev |-> "none"]

\* Which names the move has stored so far, at phase p: 0 at phase 0, 1
\* through phases 1 to 3 (the rename runs in between), 2 at phase 4.
Version(p) ==
  \* Nothing stored yet.
  IF p = 0 THEN 0
  \* The settled names are the last store.
  ELSE IF p = 4 THEN 2
  \* The names with "previous" stand while the Env renames.
  ELSE 1

\* Whether name n holds the file now. The Env's rename is two map writes,
\* phases 2 and 3: the real one adds "B" (phase 2) before it takes "A"
\* away (phase 3); the bug RemoveFirst takes "A" away first.
Holds(n) ==
  \* The old name, "A".
  IF n = "A"
  \* It holds the file until its removal.
  THEN IF Mutant = "RemoveFirst" THEN mph < 2 ELSE mph < 3
  \* The new name, "B": it holds the file from its insertion on.
  ELSE IF Mutant = "RemoveFirst" THEN mph >= 3 ELSE mph >= 2

\* The mover takes its next step, each one atomic: store both names (1),
\* the Env's first map write (2), its second (3), store the settled names
\* (4). Only when there are reopens to race, so the other configurations
\* keep this part still.
Move ==
  \* There is a reopen to race, and the move is not done.
  /\ Openers # {}
  \* ... and the move is not done.
  /\ mph < 4
  \* One step further.
  /\ mph' = mph + 1
  \* No reopen moves in this step.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<opc, over>>

\* A reopen loads the names the entry records now (the Atom load).
OLoad(o) ==
  \* It is about to load.
  /\ opc[o] = "load"
  \* It holds the names stored so far.
  /\ over' = [over EXCEPT ![o] = Version(mph)]
  \* It tries "previous" first when there is one, else "current".
  /\ opc' = [opc EXCEPT ![o] = IF NamesAt(Version(mph)).prev # "none" THEN "prev" ELSE "cur"]
  \* The move does not step here.
  /\ UNCHANGED mph

\* A reopen opens its "previous" name: found, or it tries "current".
OPrev(o) ==
  \* It is trying "previous".
  /\ opc[o] = "prev"
  \* The file is there, or it goes on to "current".
  /\ opc' = [opc EXCEPT ![o] = IF Holds(NamesAt(over[o]).prev) THEN "found" ELSE "cur"]
  \* Nothing else changes.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<mph, over>>

\* A reopen opens its "current" name: found, or it looks at the names again.
OCur(o) ==
  \* It is trying "current".
  /\ opc[o] = "cur"
  \* The file is there, or it goes to look at the names again.
  /\ opc' = [opc EXCEPT ![o] = IF Holds(NamesAt(over[o]).cur) THEN "found" ELSE "reload"]
  \* Nothing else changes.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<mph, over>>

\* A reopen whose names held nothing loads them again: if a move stored new
\* ones since, it tries those; if not, the file is really gone and it
\* reports NotFound. The bug NoReload always reports NotFound here.
OReload(o) ==
  \* Both its names held nothing.
  /\ opc[o] = "reload"
  \* Newer names: start over with them; the same ones: give up.
  /\ opc' = [opc EXCEPT ![o] =
               \* (newer names, and not the bug: load them; else: NotFound)
               IF Version(mph) # over[o] /\ Mutant # "NoReload" THEN "load" ELSE "lost"]
  \* Nothing else changes.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<mph, over>>

\* Every step anyone can take.
Next ==
  \* Parts 1 and 2: Part 3's names do not change.
  \/ /\ \/ \E r \in DiskReaders : PRead(r) \/ Seek(r) \/ ReadAtCursor(r)
        \* Or a writer's step:
        \/ \E w \in Writers :
             \* an append in place, step by step,
             \/ InPlaceClaim(w) \/ InPlaceWrite(w) \/ InPlacePublish(w)
             \* or an append through a copy, step by step.
             \/ CopyBuild(w) \/ CopyFreeze(w) \/ CopySwap(w)
        \* Or a memory reader's step.
        \/ \E r \in MemReaders : ReadBegin(r) \/ ReadLoad(r) \/ ReadLen(r) \/ ReadCopy(r)
     \* (Part 3 stays still.)
     /\ UNCHANGED nameVars
  \* Part 3: the move, or a reopen's step; Parts 1 and 2 stay still.
  \/ /\ \/ Move
        \* Or a reopen's step.
        \/ \E o \in Openers : OLoad(o) \/ OPrev(o) \/ OCur(o) \/ OReload(o)
     \* (Parts 1 and 2 stay still.)
     /\ UNCHANGED <<diskVars, memVars>>

\* The behaviours: start in Init, take Next steps.
Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_vars

\* ===========================================================================
\* THE RULES
\* ===========================================================================

\* A disk read returns the bytes at its own offset. Rules out: A seeks to 0,
\* B seeks to 1, A reads at the shared cursor and gets offset 1's bytes.
ReadsOwnBytes ==
  \* Every disk reader that read got the bytes of its own offset.
  \A r \in DiskReaders : ppc[r] = "done" => pgot[r] = Data(At[r])

\* The current buffer's published records hold every finished append.
\* Rules out: an append publishing on a buffer a copy already replaced, so
\* it "finished" where nobody will ever read.
CurrentHoldsFinished ==
  \* Every finished append is among the current buffer's published records.
  finished \subseteq Range(SubSeq(buf[cur], 1, len[cur]))

\* A memory read sees every append that finished before it began. Rules
\* out: a reader that began after an append returned and missed it.
ReadSeesFinished ==
  \* Every memory reader that is done got every append finished at its start.
  \A r \in MemReaders : rpc[r] = "done" => rfin[r] \subseteq Range(rgot[r])

\* No record is published twice in the current buffer. Rules out: an
\* append retried after a lost race that also landed the first time.
AtMostOnce ==
  \* The current buffer's published records ...
  LET s == SubSeq(buf[cur], 1, len[cur]) IN
    \* ... hold no record at two positions.
    \A i, j \in 1..Len(s) : s[i] = s[j] => i = j

\* A reopen always finds the file, however the move and it interleave.
\* Rules out: the rename takes "A" away, a reopen tries "A" and then "B"
\* before "B" is added, and the read fails on a table that exists. Rules
\* out too: a reopen that knew only "A", while the whole move ran, giving
\* up on "A" instead of looking at the names again.
OpenFindsFile ==
  \* No reopen ever ends up with nothing.
  \A o \in Openers : opc[o] # "lost"
