---- MODULE AppendedEntries ----
\* ===========================================================================
\* THE STORY
\* ===========================================================================
\* A commit-ordered log is a numbered list of entries, 1, 2, 3, ... that only
\* grows (CommitOrderedAppend.tla). Transaction::append does not write an
\* entry into the log. It puts the entry on a queue inside the transaction,
\* and the commit later gives the queued entries their positions, one after
\* another, in the order they were queued. Until then the entry has no
\* position, so a read of the log, by position or through the head, never
\* shows it (RepeatableRead.tla, the guard behind
\* MC_DefraLevel_Red_OwnAppendVisible: a reader must never see its own append
\* at a log position).
\*
\* A program that searches inside the transaction still needs to see its own
\* pending entries. Transaction::appended(log) answers that. It reads the
\* transaction's own queue, with no I/O and no read recorded, and returns the
\* entries of that one log, oldest first. It returns entries, never
\* positions, so it opens no way to see an entry at a position.
\*
\* The queue is a chain that is walked newest first, so appended(log) keeps
\* the log's entries and reverses them. A savepoint remembers how many
\* appends the queue held, and a rollback to it drops the newer ones.
\*
\* Tiny example. The transaction appends x to log l1, y to log l2, then z to
\* log l1. appended(l1) is [x, z] and appended(l2) is [y]. The commit gives
\* x and z the next two positions of l1, in that order, and y the next
\* position of l2. If a savepoint was set after x and a rollback came after
\* z, appended(l1) is [x] again.
\*
\* What can go wrong, and what this model checks cannot happen:
\*   - appended(log) is not the entries the commit numbers for that log, in
\*     the order it numbers them (INV_AppendedIsCommitOrder);
\*   - after a rollback, appended(log) is not what it was at the savepoint
\*     (INV_RollbackRestores);
\*   - before the commit, the log or its head shows a pending entry
\*     (INV_OwnAppendInvisible).
\*
\* The buffer laws for any number of appends and logs are proved in
\* proofs/lean/Regolith/Appended.lean: appended_push_same,
\* appended_push_other, rollback_restores and appended_is_commit_order. TLC
\* checks them against the commit's own numbering, step by step.
\*
\* WHAT IS MODELLED, and the code each piece mirrors (src/ unless named):
\*   | Model             | Rust                                                |

\*   |                   | first (txn_buffer.rs:435)                           |

\*   |                   | append.rs:277 appends_len                           |
\*   | Rollback          | transaction.rs:1800 rollback_to_savepoint, which    |
\*   |                   | calls append.rs:282 truncate_appends                |
\*   | Commit, todo      | engine/commit/append.rs:103 AppendOrder::number:    |

\*   | Number, store     | engine/commit/append.rs:136 number_appends: each    |

\*   | told, saved,      | ghost: what appended returned at commit, and at the |

\*
\* WHAT IS LEFT OUT, and why that loses nothing:
\*   - Other transactions: appended reads only this transaction's queue, so
\*     what others do cannot change it. The positions they take move the
\*     numbers (Base), never the order.
\*   - Once keys: a skipped append is listed by appended and gets no
\*     position. The model numbers every append, which is the case where the
\*     answer and the numbering are comparable one for one; a skipped entry
\*     only removes one position from the numbering. The test
\*     an_append_whose_once_key_the_commit_will_skip_is_still_listed pins it.
\*   - Several savepoints: one is enough, because rollback to one drops the
\*     newest appends exactly as the nested ones do, and Lean proves it for
\*     any count (rollback_restores).
\*   - Entry bytes: an entry is a number that is never reused, so two
\*     appends are never confused.
\*
\* CONFIGURATIONS (each GREEN must pass, each RED must break the one promise
\* it names):
\*   MC_AppendedEntries_Green               two logs, up to three appends,
\*                                          a savepoint and a rollback.
\*   MC_AppendedEntries_Red_NewestFirst     the reversal is missing:
\*                                          INV_AppendedIsCommitOrder.
\*   MC_AppendedEntries_Red_OtherLog        entries of other logs are
\*                                          returned too:
\*                                          INV_AppendedIsCommitOrder.
\*   MC_AppendedEntries_Red_RollbackKeeps   a rollback leaves the queue as it
\*                                          is: INV_RollbackRestores.

VARIABLES
  \* The transaction's append buffer, newest first: a sequence of pairs
  \* <<log, entry>>. Mirrors the chain walk_chain visits.
  buf,
  \* The length the buffer had at the savepoint, or -1 while none is set.
  \* Mirrors the mark a savepoint keeps (appends_len).

\* The transaction
\* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\* The transaction appends a new entry to log l.
AppendTo(l) ==
  \* It is still open, and has not yet made its last append. The count
  \* includes appends a rollback has dropped, which bounds the whole run.
  /\ phase = "open"
  \* Fewer than the allowed number of appends have been made.
  /\ next <= MaxApp
  \* The new pair goes on the front: the front is the newest.
  /\ buf' = <<<<l, next>>>> \o buf
  \* The next entry gets a new id.
  /\ next' = next + 1
  \* This is not a rollback.
  /\ rolled' = FALSE

  /\ UNCHANGED <<mark, phase, todo, store, saved, expect, told>>

\* The transaction sets a savepoint: it keeps the buffer's length and what
\* appended returns now.
Savepoint ==
  \* It is open and has no savepoint yet.
  /\ phase = "open"
  \* No savepoint is set.
  /\ mark = -1
  \* The mark is the number of appends so far.

\* are the newest, at the front, and are dropped.
Rollback ==
  \* It is open and a savepoint is set.
  /\ phase = "open"
  \* A savepoint is set.
  /\ mark >= 0
  \* The bug leaves the buffer; the real code keeps only the oldest `mark`.
  /\ buf' = IF Mutant = "RollbackKeeps" THEN buf
            \* The real code keeps the oldest `mark` appends, the tail of the newest-first buffer.
            ELSE SubSeq(buf, Len(buf) - mark + 1, Len(buf))
  \* The savepoint is used up.
  /\ mark' = -1

  /\ rolled' = TRUE
  \* The expected answers are the saved ones.
  /\ expect' = saved
  \* Nothing else changes.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<phase, todo, store, next, saved, told>>

\* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* The commit
\* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\* The commit begins: it takes the queue oldest first, the order it numbers
\* in, and the ghost notes what appended said just before.
BeginCommit ==
  \* The transaction is open.
  /\ phase = "open"
  \* The commit is giving positions now.
  /\ phase' = "numbering"
  \* The queue is the buffer read oldest first.
  /\ todo' = Reverse(buf)
  \* What appended returned for each log at this moment.
  /\ told' = [l \in Logs |-> Appended(l)]
  \* Nothing else changes.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<buf, mark, store, next, saved, rolled, expect>>

\* The commit numbers the next queued append: it takes the log's next
\* position, one past the newest.
Number ==
  \* The commit is numbering and appends remain.
  /\ phase = "numbering"
  \* At least one append is left.
  /\ todo # <<>>
  \* The first append's log takes the next position with that entry.
  /\ store' = [store EXCEPT ![Head(todo)[1]] =
                 Append(@, <<Base + Len(@) + 1, Head(todo)[2]>>)]
  \* That append is done.
  /\ todo' = Tail(todo)
  \* Nothing else changes.
  /\ UNCHANGED <<buf, mark, phase, next, saved, rolled, expect, told>>

\* Every append is numbered: the commit is over.

  \* No append is left.
  /\ todo = <<>>
  \* The transaction is done.
  /\ phase' = "done"

  \* Roll back to it.
  \/ Rollback
  \* Start the commit.

\* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* The promises
\* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\* Every variable holds the kind of value its comment says.
TypeOK ==
  \* The phase is one of the three.
  /\ phase \in {"open", "numbering", "done"}
  \* The mark is -1 or a length the buffer can have had.
  /\ mark \in -1..MaxApp
  \* The buffer is a sequence of at most MaxApp pairs.
  /\ Len(buf) <= MaxApp
  \* The ghost flag is a boolean.
  /\ rolled \in BOOLEAN

\* Promise: before the commit gives positions, nothing at a log position or
\* behind a head shows a pending entry, because the log holds only what it
\* held when the transaction began. appended gives entries, not positions.
INV_OwnAppendInvisible ==
  \* While the transaction is open, no log has a numbered entry.
  phase = "open" => \A l \in Logs : store[l] = <<>>

\* Promise: appended(l), asked just before the commit, is exactly the entries
\* the commit then numbered for l, in the order it numbered them, at
\* consecutive positions from the head up.
INV_AppendedIsCommitOrder ==
  \* Once the commit is over, for each log:
  phase = "done" => \A l \in Logs :
    \* The answer equals the numbered entries,
    /\ told[l] = Numbered(l)
    \* and they sit at the positions Base + 1, Base + 2, ...
    /\ \A i \in 1..Len(store[l]) : store[l][i][1] = Base + i

\* Promise: right after a rollback to a savepoint, appended gives for every
\* log what it gave at the savepoint.
INV_RollbackRestores ==
  \* Just after a rollback, for each log:
  rolled => \A l \in Logs : Appended(l) = expect[l]
