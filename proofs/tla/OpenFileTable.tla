---- MODULE OpenFileTable ----
\* ===========================================================================
\* THE STORY
\* ===========================================================================
\* A database keeps one file open for every table it reads. A big database,
\* or a process allowed only a few open files, runs out. So when
\* max_open_files is set, regolith keeps the open files in a small table of
\* "slots" (SlotTable, src/env/open_file_limit/slots.rs): one open file per
\* slot, never more slots than the limit. A read that finds its file in a
\* slot "joins" the slot; a read that does not "claims" a slot, closes the
\* file that was there, opens its own, and joins that.
\*
\* Tiny example. One slot, two threads. Thread 1 reads table A: it claims
\* the empty slot, opens A, reads, leaves. Thread 2 reads table B: the slot
\* holds A and nobody is reading it, so thread 2 claims it, closes A, opens B.
\* Meanwhile thread 1 comes back for A: it finds B in the slot, so it must
\* claim the slot again (later), never read B by mistake.
\*
\* What can go wrong, and what this model checks cannot happen:
\*   - more files open at once than the limit (AtMostCap);
\*   - a file closed while a thread is in the middle of reading it, so the
\*     read fails or reads freed memory (NeverClosedInUse);
\*   - a thread that saw its file in a slot joins just as the slot is
\*     reloaded with another file, and reads the wrong file (ReadsOwnFile).
\*
\* HOW A JOIN WORKS IN THE CODE (and here). A slot has a state word: its
\* phase (empty, claimed, open) and how many readers it has. A thread looks
\* at the word and at the slot's owner, then joins with one compare-and-swap
\* (CAS) on the word that adds one reader. The CAS only compares the word,
\* not the owner, so between the look and the CAS the slot could have been
\* claimed, reloaded with another file, read and left, ending with the very
\* same word. That is why the code checks the owner again AFTER the CAS:
\* once it counts as a reader, nobody can claim the slot, so the owner it
\* sees then is final.
\*
\* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* THE SECOND STORY: A READ THAT MAY NOT WAIT (decision D60)
\* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* Some reads are "CacheOnly": they promise never to wait for another thread.
\* Their device read runs later as a "unit" on the reading thread's own I/O
\* queue (src/engine/io). When that unit must reopen its table and every
\* slot is busy with other threads' reads, it may NOT wait for a slot the
\* way a "Blocking" read may. Instead it "parks":
\*   1. it puts its queue on the table's parked list (SlotTable::park,
\*      register);
\*   2. it looks at every slot again: a slot that freed meanwhile it claims;
\*      every busy slot it marks WANTED (mark_or_claim);
\*   3. the unit is parked and the poll returns (Unit::park).
\* The step that makes a WANTED slot free again (the last reader leaving)
\* clears the mark and tells every queue on the parked list "a slot freed"
\* (SlotTable::freed, wake). That message waits in the queue's inbox, and
\* the queue's next poll unparks the unit and runs it again.
\*
\* Tiny example. One slot. Thread 1 (Blocking) is reading table A in it.
\* Thread 2's unit wants table B: the slot is busy, so it puts itself on the
\* list, marks the slot WANTED, parks, and returns. Thread 1 leaves: the slot
\* is free and WANTED, so thread 1 clears the mark and tells thread 2.
\* Thread 2 polls, sees the message, and runs its unit again: it claims the
\* slot and reads B.
\*
\* What can go wrong, and what this model checks cannot happen:
\*   - the unit waits for a slot after all (NeverWaits);
\*   - the unit parks and nobody ever tells it a slot freed, so it never
\*     runs again (RetryNeverLost). Three ways to get this wrong are planted
\*     below: marking before joining the list, a publish that forgets the
\*     mark, and a wake that drops a message for a unit not yet parked.
\*
\* WHAT IS MODELLED, and the code each piece mirrors:
\*   phase, holders  the state word of each slot: Slot::state (holders is
\*                   the set of reading threads; the word holds its size)
\*   owner           Slot::owner, the table whose file the slot holds
\*   desc            Slot::file, the open file (a number per opening)
\*   alive, fileOf   the files open right now, and which table each is
\*   wanted          the WANTED bit of each slot's state word
\*   list            SlotTable::parked, the queues waiting for a free slot
\*   told            a SlotFreed message waiting in a thread's queue inbox
\*   ustate          whether a thread's unit is parked (Unit, PARKED)
\*
\* WHAT IS LEFT OUT, and why that loses nothing:
\*   - The CLOCK reference bit: it only chooses WHICH free slot a claim
\*     takes, never lets a claim take a slot with readers. The CLOCK sweep
\*     of a unit can miss a free slot; here a unit's sweep may always give
\*     up (SweepMiss), which covers every way it can miss.
\*   - The DRAIN bit: it makes a starved Blocking thread wait for one slot's
\*     current readers instead of looking forever; like CLOCK it changes
\*     which claim happens and when, not whether a claim can take a slot
\*     with readers. The loom model a_starved_open_drains_a_busy_slot checks
\*     it, and the unit test a_drained_slot_keeps_its_mark_and_the_drainers_
\*     leave_wakes checks that a drain keeps the WANTED mark.
\*   - Memory ordering: the loom models (tests/loom_tables.rs) check it.
\*   - Removing a table while it is read (renamed aside, unlinked by the
\*     last reader): it never closes a slot's file, so it adds no step here.
\*   - A claim that fails to open its file and empties its slot: it wakes
\*     the parked list exactly like a leave (SlotTable::settle).
\*
\* CONFIGURATIONS (each GREEN must pass, each RED must break the one
\* invariant it names):
\*   MC_OpenFileTable_Green           one slot, two threads, two tables.
\*   MC_OpenFileTable_Green_TwoSlots  two slots, three threads.
\*   MC_OpenFileTable_Green_NoWait    one slot; thread 2 is a queue unit;
\*                                    the liveness check UnitsFinish too.
\*   MC_OpenFileTable_Green_NoWaitTwoSlots  two slots; threads 2 and 3 are
\*                                    units, on the parked list together.
\*   MC_OpenFileTable_Red_IgnoreReaders   a claim that takes a slot whatever
\*                                    its readers: NeverClosedInUse breaks.
\*   MC_OpenFileTable_Red_NoOwnerRecheck  a join that trusts the owner it
\*                                    saw before its CAS: ReadsOwnFile breaks.
\*   MC_OpenFileTable_Red_OutsideTable    a thread that finds no free slot
\*                                    opens its file outside the table:
\*                                    AtMostCap breaks.
\*   MC_OpenFileTable_Red_Waits       a unit that waits for a slot like a
\*                                    Blocking read: NeverWaits breaks.
\*   MC_OpenFileTable_Red_MarkFirst   a park that marks before it joins the
\*                                    list: RetryNeverLost breaks.
\*   MC_OpenFileTable_Red_PublishDropsWanted  a publish that rewrites the
\*                                    word without the mark: RetryNeverLost
\*                                    breaks.
\*   MC_OpenFileTable_Red_WakeNeedsParked  a wake that tells only units
\*                                    already parked: RetryNeverLost breaks.
\*
\* Lean, proofs/lean/Regolith/OpenFileTable.lean, proves the first three
\* rules for every number of slots, threads and steps;
\* proofs/lean/Regolith/OpenFileNoWait.lean proves NeverWaits and
\* RetryNeverLost the same way.

\* The behaviours where no thread stops for good while it has a step: each

FairSpec == Spec /\ \A t \in Threads : WF_vars(OwnStep(t))

\* ===========================================================================
\* THE RULES
\* ===========================================================================

\* Never more open files than slots. Rules out: every slot busy, and a
\* thread opening its table anyway, so the process holds one file more than
\* max_open_files allows. The code keeps every open file in a slot.
AtMostCap == Cardinality(alive) <= Cap

\* A file a thread is reading through is still open. Rules out: thread 1
\* mid-read on table A's file, thread 2 claims the slot and closes it, and
\* thread 1's read fails or reads a closed file. The code's claim CAS only
\* wins with no readers counted.
NeverClosedInUse ==
  \* For every thread that is reading or about to leave, its file is open.
  \A t \in Threads : pc[t] \in {"read", "leave"} => using[t] \in alive

\* A read returns the table its thread asked for. Rules out: a thread sees
\* A in the slot, the slot is reloaded with B, read and left with the same
\* state word, and the thread's CAS joins B. The recheck after the CAS
\* catches it.
ReadsOwnFile ==
  \* For every thread that has read, what it got is the table it wanted.
  \A t \in Threads : pc[t] = "leave" => got[t] = Want[t]

\* A queue unit never waits for another thread (D60). Whatever state the
\* other threads are in, a unit that is in the middle of its read (not
\* parked with its poll returned, not done) always has a step of its own it
\* can take. Rules out: thread 1 reads in the only slot, thread 2's unit
\* finds no free slot and sits at "claim" until thread 1 leaves, so the
\* poll that ran it waits on thread 1. A Blocking read may do exactly that.
NeverWaits ==
  \* For every unit in the middle of a read: some step of its own can be taken.
  \A t \in NoWait : pc[t] \notin {"idle", "done"} => ENABLED OwnStep(t)

\* A parked unit is never forgotten. Each parked unit already has a "slot
\* freed" message waiting, or will get one: its queue is on the parked list
\* and some slot is WANTED and busy (the step that frees it wakes the
\* list), or a leaver that freed a wanted slot is on its way to waking the
\* list. Rules out: thread 2 marks the slot, thread 1 leaves and wakes an
\* empty list, then thread 2 joins the list and parks: nobody will ever
\* tell it, and its read never runs again.
RetryNeverLost ==
  \* For every parked unit:
  \A t \in NoWait : ustate[t] = "parked" =>
    \* its message is there already, or
    \/ told[t]
    \* its queue is on the list, and
    \/ /\ t \in list
       \* some slot is marked and busy, or
       /\ \/ \E s \in Slots : wanted[s] /\ ~Claimable(s)
          \* a reader that freed a marked slot is on its way to waking the list.
          \/ \E r \in Threads : pc[r] \in {"clearW", "wake"}

\* Liveness, under fair scheduling: every queue unit finishes all its reads.
\* Checked by the GREEN no-wait configurations.
