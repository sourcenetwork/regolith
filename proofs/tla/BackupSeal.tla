---- MODULE BackupSeal ----
\* Backups of a database encrypted at rest, and their restores (plan 4.12,
\* D57).
\*
\* THE STORY. regolith's BackupEngine (src/backup.rs) copies a database's
\* tables into a shared pool, one file per table named by its content, and
\* writes one small metadata file per backup saying which tables it holds,
\* where each goes and which keys each one spans. On an encrypted database
\* the tables are already sealed, but before D57 that metadata was plain
\* text: anyone with the backup disk could read the smallest and largest
\* key of every table, and a restore wrote a plain MANIFEST that said the
\* same. D57 seals the metadata through the database's own key provider.
\*
\* Picture one database, key 1 current, two tables. Backup 1 copies both
\* tables and writes its metadata sealed under key 1. The operator rotates
\* to key 2 and takes backup 2. Months later someone restores backup 1 with
\* a provider whose current key is 2. Things that can go wrong:
\*   - the metadata, or the restored MANIFEST, is written in plain text;
\*   - the restore opens backup 1 under the CURRENT key (2), not the key the
\*     file names (1), and refuses a provider that has every key it needs;
\*   - someone edits the plain listing (which names the shared files) so it
\*     points at another backup's copy of a table, or renames backup 2's
\*     file to backup 1's name, and the restore puts back the wrong tables;
\*   - the restore refuses (no key, a wrong key, a missing key) only after
\*     it has already copied tables into the target;
\*   - deleting a backup removes a shared table a sealed backup still needs,
\*     because the engine holds no key and skipped what it could not read;
\*   - a power cut leaves metadata that lists a table the pool never got,
\*     or a MANIFEST naming a table the target never got;
\*   - a restore runs over a target that is already a database;
\*   - backup 2's metadata stops reading (a flipped bit, a file a newer
\*     build wrote, a disk that fails the read) and the listing quietly
\*     leaves it out, so whoever reads the list believes it has every
\*     backup when it does not; or the listing needs a key, and leaves out
\*     every sealed backup;
\*   - a delete counts only the listings it can read, and removes the
\*     tables unreadable backup 2 lists, which a newer build, or the disk
\*     once it reads again, would need.
\*
\* WHAT THE CODE DOES (each line below is one of these, by name).
\*   create_backup resolves the sealer for the current key first, copies
\*     every table it lists into the pool (each copy is written to a staging
\*     name, synced, renamed and its directory synced, so it lands whole or
\*     not at all), and only then writes the metadata the same way, sealed
\*     under that key and naming it.
\*   The metadata keeps the listing (each table's content id and size, which
\*     the pool's file names show anyway) in the clear, so listing and
\*     deleting need no key, and binds it with the tag: the tag's associated
\*     data is the backup id and every clear byte (src/backup/format.rs).
\*   restore refuses a target that holds a MANIFEST, then reads the metadata
\*     and checks, before it writes anything: a provider is given, it has the
\*     key the file names, the tag holds (right key bytes, listing unchanged,
\*     the file is the one this id wrote), and it has its current key and
\*     every key a table names. Then it copies every listed table into the
\*     target, and writes the MANIFEST last, sealed under the current key.
\*   list_backups names every metadata file in meta/ by its backup id, with
\*     its summary when its metadata reads and the reason when it does not.
\*     It reads only the clear listing, so it needs no key.
\*   delete_backup removes one backup's metadata, purge_old_backups the
\*     metadata of every backup but the newest `keep` by id, readable or
\*     not. Both make that durable, then sweep the pool (collect_shared,
\*     src/backup/collect.rs): the walk of shared/ hands the pool files out
\*     a batch of Sweep at a time; for each batch the sweep walks meta/ one
\*     entry at a time (Env::read_dir hands entries out a batch of Batch at
\*     a time, the way readdir fills its buffer), reads each listing as the
\*     walk reaches it, sealed or not, and strikes every candidate it names;
\*     only once that walk has handed out its last entry does it remove the
\*     candidates left, and go on to the next batch. So it removes every
\*     pool file no remaining listing names (those the deleted backups held,
\*     and those a backup cut short copied and never listed), holding one
\*     batch of candidates and one listing, never the pool and never every
\*     listing. A listing that cannot be read stops the sweep: it removes
\*     nothing more.
\*
\* A SWEEP, IN ONE PICTURE. Backups 1 and 3 share table t; backup 2 does not
\* list it. Delete backup 1: t is a candidate in some batch, and that
\* batch's walk of meta/ hands out backup 2's file, then backup 3's.
\* Reading 2 strikes nothing, reading 3 strikes t, and t stays. Were the
\* walk to lose backup 3's file where one batch of entries ends and the next
\* begins, t would never be struck, and the delete would remove a table
\* backup 3 still lists. Were the walk of shared/ to lose the table that
\* starts a batch of candidates, that table would never be a candidate, and
\* a table nobody lists would stay in the pool for ever.
\*
\* WHAT IS CHECKED.
\*   SealedMetadata        no backup's metadata, and no restored MANIFEST, is
\*                         plain text.
\*   RightKeysRestore      a restore never refuses a provider that has every
\*                         key the backup needs, after a rotation too.
\*   FaithfulRestore       a finished restore holds exactly the tables the
\*                         backup recorded when it was taken.
\*   RefusalWritesNothing  a refused restore wrote nothing.
\*   ListedRestores        every table an untampered backup lists is in the
\*                         pool, after any delete and any power cut, even
\*                         while its metadata does not read.
\*   ListingNamesEvery     the listing names every backup the repository
\*                         holds: readable or not, sealed or not.
\*   CollectionBounded     the sweep's candidates are only ever one batch of
\*                         pool files: it holds that, however many backups
\*                         and tables there are.
\*   SweepRemovesEveryUnlisted  a sweep that finishes leaves no pool file
\*                         that no remaining listing names.

\*                                                SweepRemovesEveryUnlisted
\*
\* WHAT THE MODEL LEAVES OUT, and why that loses nothing.
\*   - Bytes. A table is its content id <<t, k>>: table slot t sealed under
\*     key k. Two copies of one table under one key are one pool file, as
\*     content addressing makes them.
\*   - The checksum in front of the tag. It catches accidental damage with
\*     no key; a deliberate change keeps it valid, which is the case here.
\*   - Each copy's own crash steps. Every file is written to a staging name,
\*     synced and renamed, so a power cut leaves it whole or absent: one step
\*     here. A power cut is the Crash step, which drops what was in flight.
\*   - Unencrypted databases: their backups stay plain, as they always were,
\*     and none of these rules is about them.
\*   - Why a file does not read. A flipped bit (the checksum fails), a
\*     version a newer build wrote, and a disk that fails the read all look
\*     the same to the engine: the metadata does not decode. One flag,
\*     `reads`, stands for all three.
\*   - The order the walks hand entries out in. A directory picks its own
\*     order; here the walk of shared/ hands pool files out by slot and key,
\*     and the walk of meta/ hands listings out by id. Each batch of
\*     candidates is checked against every listing, so the order of either
\*     walk changes no decision the sweep makes: the Lean proof shows it for
\*     every order and every batching (collect_stream_eq, sweep_stream_eq).
\*     The REDs that lose an entry at a boundary still lose one here.
\*   - The walk of meta/ that breaks part way: the sweep stops and removes
\*     nothing more, as for a listing that does not read, which stands for
\*     both.
\*
\* CONFIGURATIONS.
\*   MC_BackupSeal_Green                   every invariant holds
\*   MC_BackupSeal_Green_Stream            every invariant holds with three
\*                                         backups and a batch boundary after
\*                                         every entry of the walk of meta/
\*   MC_BackupSeal_Green_Sweep             every invariant holds with three
\*                                         backups and a batch boundary after
\*                                         every pool file of the sweep
\*   MC_BackupSeal_Red_<defect>            the promise named above fails
\*
\* The Lean proof Regolith/BackupSeal.lean proves the rules for every number
\* of backups and tables, every batching and every order: collect_keeps_listed,
\* collect_stops_on_unreadable and collect_removes_every_unlisted for one
\* collection; collect_stream_eq, stream_keeps_listed and
\* stream_holds_one_batch for one batch read listing by listing; sweep_eq
\* and sweep_removes_every_unlisted for the sweep, batch after batch; and
\* list_pages_all for the listing a page of ids at a time. The StreamSkips,
\* SweepSkips and page-boundary counterexamples are
\* stream_skip_removes_a_listed_file, sweep_skip_leaves_an_unlisted_file and
\* page_skip_loses_a_backup.

\* Naturals for counting backups and restores; FiniteSets for counting how
\* many backups are newer than one, which a purge needs, and how many

\* The state: everything that changes from one step to the next. Each line says what the variable
\* stands for in the real program.
VARIABLES
  \* The database's tables: live[t] is the key table slot t is sealed under,
  \* 0 when the slot holds no table (Version.levels; SsTableReader::seal_key).
  live,
  \* The key the database's provider names current (KeyProvider::current).
  current,
  \* The tables durable in the pool: backup_dir/shared/<content id>.sst.
  shared,
  \* meta[b]: backup b's metadata file, a record:
  \*   on       whether the file exists (Absent is the one that does not);
  \*   key      the key id it is sealed under and names, Plain when plain;
  \*   listing  each slot's content id as the clear listing says now;
  \*   sealed   the listing the tag was computed over when it was written;
  \*   body     the sealed part: which table each slot gets (file id, key
  \*            range, the key the table names);
  \*   bound    the backup id the tag binds (the file's name when written);
\*   reads    whether the engine can read it at all: FALSE once a bit
\*            flipped, a newer build rewrote it, or the disk fails the read
\*            (format::decode_listing returns an error).
  meta,
  \* What backup b held when it was taken, by id: a ghost the checks read,
  \* nothing in the program stores it.
  recorded,
  \* The backup in flight (BackupEngine::create_backup): phase "idle" or
  \* "copy", the id it will write, the tables it lists, the key it seals
  \* under.
  bk,
  \* The restore target's table files: tgt[t] is what sits in its sst/ dir
  \* under slot t's file id.
  tgt,
  \* The restore target's MANIFEST: whether there is one (on), what it
  \* names (body), whether it is sealed, and the tables the backup recorded
  \* (want, a ghost).
  tman,
  \* The restore in flight (BackupEngine::restore): its phase ("idle",
  \* "check", "copy", "refused"), the backup id, the provider, the metadata
  \* it read, what that backup recorded (ghost), whether the provider was
  \* entitled to it (ghost), and whether it wrote into the target yet.
  rs,
  \* How many backups were started: bounds the model.
  made,
  \* How many restores were started: bounds the model.
  restores,
  \* How many times a file changed behind the engine's back (the attacker
  \* edited a listing or swapped two files, or a file stopped reading): at
  \* most once, which keeps the model small and is all any rule needs.
  adv,
  \* The collection in flight (collect_shared, src/backup/collect.rs), a
  \* record:
  \*   phase   "idle"; "batch" when it takes the next batch of candidates;
  \*           "walk" while that batch's walk of meta/ reads the listings;
  \*           "remove" once the walk is done; "done" once the walk of
  \*           shared/ is used up; "stopped" once a listing did not read;
  \*   sorder  the pool files, in the order the walk of shared/ hands them
  \*           out (fixed when the collection starts);
  \*   spos    how many of them the walk of shared/ has handed out;
  \*   from    the batch's pool files (a ghost: the code holds only what
  \*           is left of them, below);
  \*   cand    the candidates still standing: the batch's files no listing
  \*           read so far names (the `unlisted` set);
  \*   order   the backups' metadata files in the order this batch's walk
  \*           of meta/ hands them out (Env::read_dir; by id here);
  \*   pos     how many entries that walk has handed out so far.
  gc

\* Every variable, so a step that changes none of them is a stutter.

  \* The batch in hand is a set of pool files.
  /\ gc.from \subseteq Objs
  \* The candidates for removal are pool files.
  /\ gc.cand \subseteq Objs
  \* The walk's order is a sequence of backup ids.
  /\ gc.order \in Seq(Ids)
  \* Its position is within the backups, or one past them.
  /\ gc.pos \in 0..MaxBackups + 1

\* No backup's metadata is plain, and no restored MANIFEST is. It rules out
\* the PlainMeta story (backup 1's file names every table's key range in
\* plain text) and the PlainRestore story (a restore with the right key
\* writes a MANIFEST that names them all in plain text). This is D57.
SealedMetadata ==
  \* Every metadata file names a key it is sealed under.
  /\ \A b \in Ids : meta[b].on => meta[b].key \in Keys
  \* Every restored MANIFEST is sealed.
  /\ tman.on => tman.sealed

\* A restore never refuses a provider that has every key the backup needs.
\* It rules out the OpenUnderCurrent story: backup 1 sealed under key 1, the
\* provider rotated to key 2 but still holding key 1, and the restore
\* refusing because it tried key 2.
RightKeysRestore == rs.phase = "refused" => ~rs.ent

\* A finished restore holds exactly what the backup held when it was taken:
\* its MANIFEST names those tables, and each sits in the target. It rules
\* out the ListingUnbound story (an edited listing puts another backup's
\* copy of a table under this backup's MANIFEST), the IdUnbound story
\* (backup 2's file under backup 1's name restores backup 2 as backup 1),
\* the ManifestFirst story (a power cut after the MANIFEST and before the
\* tables) and the OverDatabase story (a restore over a finished target
\* replaces tables its MANIFEST names).
FaithfulRestore ==
  \* When the target has a MANIFEST...
  tman.on =>
    \* ...it names exactly the tables the backup recorded...
    /\ tman.body = tman.want
    \* ...and each one it names is in the target.
    /\ \A t \in Tables : tman.body[t] # NoObj => tgt[t] = tman.body[t]

\* A refused restore wrote nothing. It rules out the CheckAfterCopy story:
\* a provider without its current key is refused only after every table was
\* copied into the target.
RefusalWritesNothing == rs.phase = "refused" => ~rs.wrote

\* Every table a backup lists is in the pool, unless the attacker edited
\* that listing, and even while the file does not read: the read may come
\* back, or a newer build read it. It rules out the GcSkipsSealed story
\* (deleting backup 1 removes a table sealed backup 2 still lists), the
\* GcSkipsUnreadable story (deleting backup 1 removes a table unreadable
\* backup 2 still lists) and the MetaFirst story (a power cut after the
\* metadata and before its tables).
ListedRestores ==
  \* For every backup id b:
  \A b \in Ids :
    \* For a file whose listing is the one it was sealed with...
    (meta[b].on /\ meta[b].listing = meta[b].sealed) =>
      \* ...every table it lists is in the pool.
      \A t \in Tables : meta[b].listing[t] # NoObj => meta[b].listing[t] \in shared

\* The sweep's candidates are always among one batch's pool files, at most
\* Sweep of them: striking only ever takes files away. It rules out a
\* collection that gathers the pool, or what every backup lists, into one
\* set, which grows with the repository; the code keeps one batch.
CollectionBounded ==
  \* Candidates come from the batch...
  /\ gc.cand \subseteq gc.from
  \* ...and a batch holds at most Sweep files.
  /\ Cardinality(gc.from) <= Sweep

\* A sweep that finishes leaves no pool file that no remaining listing
\* names: those the deleted backups held, and those a backup cut short
\* copied and never listed, are all gone. It rules out the SweepSkips story
\* (the walk of shared/ loses the file that starts the second batch, so it
\* is never a candidate and stays in the pool, listed by nobody, for ever).
SweepRemovesEveryUnlisted ==
  \* Once the sweep is done...
  gc.phase = "done" =>
    \* ...every pool file is one a remaining listing names.
    shared \subseteq UNION {Held(meta[c].listing) : c \in Present}

\* What list_backups returns at this moment: the id of every backup it
\* names, each with its summary or the reason it cannot be read (the model
\* keeps only the ids, which is what the rule below is about). It reads the
\* directory and each file's clear listing, so it changes nothing and needs
\* no key: it is a function of the files, checked in every state.
\* ListSkipsUnreadable leaves out a file that does not read, as the code did
\* before; ListNeedsKey leaves out a sealed file, as a listing that opened
\* the seal would with no key at hand.
Listing ==
  \* Of the ids whose file is in meta/, the ones the listing names:
  {b \in Present :
     \* all of them for the engine; the first defect drops each file that
     \* does not read...
     /\ Mutant = "ListSkipsUnreadable" => meta[b].reads
     \* ...and the second drops each sealed one.
     /\ Mutant = "ListNeedsKey" => meta[b].key = Plain}

\* The listing names every backup the repository holds, readable or not,
\* sealed or not, and nothing else. It rules out the ListSkipsUnreadable
\* story (backup 2's metadata flips a bit, the list shows only backup 1,
\* and the caller believes backup 1 is all there is) and the ListNeedsKey
\* story (an engine with no key lists no backup of an encrypted database).
\* A caller deciding what to keep, delete or restore needs the whole list.
ListingNamesEvery ==
  \* The ids the listing names are exactly the ids with a file in meta/.
  Listing = Present
