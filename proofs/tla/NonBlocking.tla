\* ===========================================================================
\* THE STORY
\* ===========================================================================
\* regolith reads a table block from the disk when a reader needs it and the
\* block cache does not hold it. A thread that must never block cannot wait
\* for that disk read. So each such thread holds its own "I/O queue" (an
\* IoQueue in src/io_queue/queue.rs), and reads through a CacheOnly handle:
\*   - the read looks in the cache; on a miss it does NOT touch the disk.
\*     It records the block on its own queue and returns WouldBlock at once;
\*   - later, when the thread has nothing else to do, it polls its queue.
\*     The poll does the disk reads its thread is waiting for, and hands
\*     every waiting read a "you can run again now" note;
\*   - the read runs again and finds its block.
\*
\* Tiny example. Two threads, A and B, both miss block 7 at the same moment.
\* There is ONE "unit" for block 7 (a single-flight read, src/engine/io/unit.rs).
\* A polls first and grabs the unit with one compare-and-swap; B's poll sees
\* it taken and leaves it alone. A reads block 7 once, then puts one "done"
\* note into A's inbox and one into B's inbox. B was asleep ("idle"), so the
\* note to B also wakes B up. A was awake, so nothing wakes A: it just finds
\* the note at its next poll.
\*
\* What can go wrong, and what this model checks cannot happen:
\*   - a note lands in the wrong thread's inbox, so the wrong thread finishes
\*     a read and the right one never hears (OwnQueue);
\*   - a thread is told twice, or a thread that asked is never told
\*     (ExactlyOnce, EveryWaiterTold);
\*   - two threads both grab the same unit and read the block twice
\*     (SingleRun);
\*   - a thread goes to sleep right as a note arrives and sleeps forever with
\*     a note in its inbox (NoLostIdleWakeup);
\*   - a thread that is busy gets woken anyway (BusyNeverWoken);
\*   - some I/O regolith starts by itself is put on nobody's queue, so it
\*     never runs (NoOrphanUnit);
\*   - and, over whole runs: every read and every job finishes, with many
\*     threads or with one (the single-threaded wasm case) (AllDone).
\*
\* THE COMMIT SIDE (commit units). Writes take the same path:
\*   - commits made by commit_nowait that need an fsync wait on ONE unit,
\*     the sync round that covers their records (the round is the one claim
\*     on the log's device step, src/engine/commit/round.rs). Each such
\*     commit puts a note for it on its OWN queue; the first of those queues
\*     to poll claims it with one CAS and runs the fsync; every one of them
\*     is told once. A thread that needs the log durable inside a blocking
\*     call may run it too (LandHere), and close runs it. Tiny example:
\*     threads A and B commit, and round 4 covers both; B polls first, syncs
\*     once, and the note to A wakes A.
\*     What can go wrong: the fsync runs twice (SingleRun), the commits are
\*     visible before the fsync (VisibleAfterSync), or B's poll makes A's
\*     ticket ready on B's thread instead of at A's own poll
\*     (DeliveredOnOwnPoll);
\*   - a write a stall stops returns at once with a wait; every writer
\*     stopped during one stall waits on one PASSIVE unit, which no poll
\*     runs and which lands only when the stall clears. A writer installs
\*     or finds the unit, registers on its own queue, and only then looks at
\*     the stall again, landing the unit itself if it cleared meanwhile.
\*     What can go wrong: a writer installs the unit just after the clearer
\*     looked, and nobody ever lands it (StallLandsWhenClear).
\*     A transaction's commit cannot be made a second time, so a stall does
\*     not end it: a commit_nowait commit is left on its queue behind the
\*     stall's unit and goes on at the poll that finds the unit landed, and
\*     a blocking commit sleeps on the unit (RegolithEngine::admit_commit and
\*     admit_commit_nowait, src/engine/mod.rs). Both are waiters of the unit
\*     like any stopped write and look at the stall again once they have it:
\*     the writer below that registers, looks again and later runs again
\*     (WriteTry, Rerun) stands for them.
\*
\* TIMED WAITS. A transaction that lost its commit may wait a little before
\* it runs again (RetryPolicy::backoff). A thread that must never block
\* cannot sleep, so its task asks the thread's queue for a "timed wait"
\* (IoRuntime::timer, src/engine/io/mod.rs): ready once the clock reaches a
\* due time. The request is a note in the queue's inbox like any other. The
\* owner's poll takes it in, and the first poll that finds the clock at the
\* due time or later completes it (Timers, src/io_queue/timers.rs). Nobody
\* is woken for a timed wait and nothing sleeps for one: each poll tells the
\* owner how long it may idle until the next one is due
\* (IoProgress::wake_in), and the owner polls again by then.
\* Tiny example. At time 40 thread A asks for a wait due at 100. A's poll at
\* 60 leaves it and says "idle at most 40". A's poll at 100 completes it.
\* What can go wrong: the wait lands on another thread's queue
\* (TimerOnOwnQueue); a poll completes it before it is due (TimerNotEarly);
\* A goes idle, the wait comes due, and A sleeps for ever because nothing
\* wakes it (AllDone, with an owner that polls again in time: TimerWake);
\* A drops its queue and the task waiting on the wait is never told
\* (DroppedHoldsNothing).
\*
\* WHAT IS MODELLED, and the code each piece mirrors:
\*   unit        a single-flight read: Unit, src/engine/io/unit.rs
\*   table       the unit table: IoRuntime::units, src/engine/io/mod.rs
\*   inbox       a queue's lock-free inbox: QueueShared::inbox,
\*               src/engine/io/shared.rs, a Stack with an IDLE flag bit
\*   waiting     the units a queue registered on: IoQueue::waiting
\*   slot        one read's wait: WaitSlot, behind each IoWait
\*   have        what a re-run read finds for its queue: the reads that
\*               landed for the queue (QueueShared::landed). The block cache
\*               is left out on purpose: it only ever makes a re-run find its
\*               block sooner, so this is the hard case, the one where only
\*               the landing carries the read (a disabled cache).
\*   timed       the timed waits a queue's owner holds: IoQueue::timers,
\*               src/io_queue/queue.rs
\*   elapsed     the clock, as far as a timed wait can tell: the waits whose
\*               due time it has reached (Env::now_micros read by a poll)
\*   dropped     the queues that are gone: Drop for IoQueue
\*
\* WHAT IS LEFT OUT, and why that loses nothing:
\*   - Memory ordering and the exact CAS loops: the loom models check those
\*     (tests/loom_io_queue.rs). Here each CAS is one atomic step.
\*   - The byte bound on a queue: it delays a read (a "room" wait) but never
\*     changes who is told what.
\*   - What a dropped queue does with its units: it releases them exactly
\*     as close does (Release below), which adds no new kind of step. What
\*     it does with its timed waits is a step of its own (DropQueue), so the
\*     threads that may drop a queue here wait on timed waits only.
\*   - The clock as a number, and how long an owner may idle: a timed wait
\*     is either due or not, and an owner that holds a due one runs again
\*     (TimerWake). Lean keeps the numbers: poll_after_wake_in_completes.
\*   - Read failures: a failed unit is told to its waiters like a landed one;
\*     only what lands differs.
\*   - Jobs (I/O regolith starts itself: the flush or the bounded step a
\*     write leaves owing with no worker, the disk check, compact_range,
\*     an ingest or a checkpoint run on the caller's queue) take the very
\*     same path as a read's miss (a unit, a request on the starting
\*     thread's own queue, src/engine/io/job.rs); SelfStart stands for all
\*     of them.
\*   - What a sync round writes and publishes: CommitPipeline.tla checks
\*     which commits a round covers, their order and the failure path. Here
\*     a round is a unit whose finish is its fsync, then the publication of
\*     the commits it covers.
\*
\* CONFIGURATIONS (each GREEN must pass, each RED must break the one
\* invariant it names):
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Green_Pool       two threads miss one block, and one of
\*                                   them a second block of its own.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Green_Jobs       two threads miss one block while a
\*                                   call on one of them starts a job.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Green_Single     one thread does everything (wasm).
\*   Those three check every invariant. That everything finishes (AllDone)
\*   is checked by three smaller runs, since the property costs three times
\*   the invariants at full size:
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Green_PoolLive   two threads miss one block.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Green_JobsLive   one thread misses a block, the other
\*                                   starts a job.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Green_SingleLive one thread, one block and a job.
\*   (Both pool setups at once, two blocks and a job, also passes: 2,283,135
\*   distinct states, about three minutes on eight workers; too slow for
\*   the recipe's single worker, so the recipe checks the two halves.)
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Red_WrongQueue   a read's request goes to the other
\*                                   thread's queue: OwnQueue breaks.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Red_LostIdleWakeup  an owner checks "inbox empty" and
\*                                   marks itself idle in two steps:
\*                                   NoLostIdleWakeup breaks.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Red_DoubleRun    a claim that also succeeds on a claimed
\*                                   unit: SingleRun breaks.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Red_SelfIoNowhere  a job's unit is put on no queue:
\*                                   NoOrphanUnit breaks.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Red_BusyWoken    a poll that forgets to clear the idle
\*                                   flag: BusyNeverWoken breaks.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Green_Commit     two threads commit with commit_nowait
\*                                   and one round covers both; any thread
\*                                   may run it.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Green_Stall      two writers stopped by one stall.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Red_DoubleSync   the DoubleRun claim on a round: its
\*                                   fsync runs twice, SingleRun breaks.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Red_PublishAtWrite  commits visible as soon as they are
\*                                   written: VisibleAfterSync breaks.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Red_DeliverOnLander  the thread that runs a round makes
\*                                   every waiting commit's ticket ready
\*                                   itself: DeliveredOnOwnPoll breaks.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Red_NoRecheck    a stopped writer that does not look at
\*                                   the stall again after registering:
\*                                   StallLandsWhenClear breaks.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Green_Timer      a thread asks for a timed wait beside
\*                                   its read; another asks for one and may
\*                                   drop its queue. Every invariant.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Green_TimerLive  two threads with a timed wait each, one
\*                                   of which may drop its queue: every
\*                                   timed wait finishes (AllDone).
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Red_IdlePastDue  an owner that stays idle past a timed
\*                                   wait's due time: AllDone breaks.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Red_EarlyFire    a poll that completes a timed wait
\*                                   without looking at the clock:
\*                                   TimerNotEarly breaks.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Red_DropForgets  a dropped queue that leaves its timed
\*                                   waits pending: DroppedHoldsNothing
\*                                   breaks.
\*   MC_NonBlocking_Red_TimerWrongQueue  a timed wait's note goes to the
\*                                   other thread's queue: TimerOnOwnQueue
\*                                   breaks.
\*
\* Lean, proofs/lean/Regolith/IoQueue.lean, proves the same rules for every
\* number of threads and units, the commit units included: round_sync_once
\* (SingleRun for a round), round_visible_after_sync (VisibleAfterSync),
\* ticket_ready_only_at_own_poll (DeliveredOnOwnPoll) and
\* stall_lands_when_clear (StallLandsWhenClear), with the RED cases
\* lander_delivery_breaks_own_poll and no_recheck_strands_stall. For timed
\* waits, with the clock as a number: timed_wait_completed_once,
\* timed_wait_completed_by_owner (TimerOnOwnQueue), timed_wait_not_before_due
\* (TimerNotEarly), dropped_queue_holds_no_wait (DroppedHoldsNothing) and
\* poll_after_wake_in_completes (AllDone for a timed wait), with the RED
\* cases early_fire_breaks_due and idle_owner_never_completes.

\* We use numbers, sequences (for inboxes) and finite sets.

\* (IoProgress::wake_in). The clock is not a number here: `elapsed` holds

\* Thread t asks its queue for timed wait x (IoRuntime::timer): a "timer"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* THE WHOLE SYSTEM

\* Any step of thread t (as reader, owner, or runner).
ThreadStep(t) ==
  \* A read that finds its block, or the database closed.
  \/ \E x \in Blocks : Hit(t, x)
  \* A read that misses.
  \/ \E x \in Blocks : Miss(t, x)
  \* A job regolith starts on t's call.
  \/ \E j \in Jobs : SelfStart(t, j)
  \* A commit_nowait returns.
  \/ \E r \in Rounds : CommitNowait(t, r)
  \* A commit_nowait after close is refused.
  \/ \E r \in Rounds : CommitClosed(t, r)
  \* t, not polling, runs a round nobody runs.
  \/ \E u \in Ids : LandHere(t, u)
  \* A write runs, or meets a stall.
  \/ \E s \in Stalls : WriteTry(t, s)
  \* A stopped write registers its wait.
  \/ \E s \in Stalls : StallWait(t, s)
  \* A stopped write looks at the stall again.
  \/ \E s \in Stalls : StallRecheck(t, s)
  \* A ready wait runs again.
  \/ \E x \in Things : Rerun(t, x)
  \* The poll takes the inbox.
  \/ Take(t)
  \* The poll handles a note.
  \/ Handle(t)
  \* The poll claims a unit.
  \/ \E u \in Ids : Claim(t, u)
  \* A claimed unit's read finishes.
  \/ \E u \in Ids : Finish(t, u)
  \* The owner goes idle.
  \/ Rest(t)
  \* Bug only: the second half of going idle.
  \/ MarkIdle(t)
  \* A woken owner runs.
  \/ Wake(t)
  \* A task asks for a timed wait.
  \/ \E x \in Timers : AskTimer(t, x)
  \* The poll completes a due timed wait.
  \/ \E x \in Timers : Fire(t, x)
  \* An idle owner runs again for a due timed wait.
  \/ TimerWake(t)
  \* The owner drops its queue.
  \/ DropQueue(t)

\* Every possible step.
Next ==
  \* Some thread steps.
  \/ \E t \in Threads : ThreadStep(t)
  \* The clock reaches a timed wait's due time.
  \/ \E x \in Timers : Elapse(x)
  \* An owner wakes on its own.
  \/ \E t \in Threads : SelfWake(t)
  \* A finisher tells a queue.
  \/ \E u \in Ids, q \in Threads : Tell(u, q)
  \* The database closes.
  \/ Close
  \* Close lets a unit go.
  \/ \E u \in Ids : Release(u)
  \* Background work clears a stall.
  \/ \E s \in Stalls : Clear(s)

\* The behaviours: start at Init, take Next steps, and never stop a step
\* that stays possible (weak fairness). An owner waking on its own, close
\* and the drop of a queue are not forced: liveness must not lean on them.
Spec ==
  \* Start.
  /\ Init
  \* Step.

  \* Each thread keeps going while it can.

       /\ WF_vars(TimerWake(t))
  \* Time passes: every timed wait asked for comes due in the end.
  /\ \A x \in Timers : WF_vars(Elapse(x))
  \* Every finisher tells every queue it owes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* WHAT MUST ALWAYS HOLD

\* Every variable holds the kind of value it should.
TypeOK ==
  \* Table entries are unit numbers or none.
  /\ table \in [Things -> Ids \cup {NoUnit}]
  \* Each unit reads a thing, or nothing yet.
  /\ what \in [Ids -> Things \cup {NoUnit}]
  \* Each unit is in one of four states.
  /\ state \in [Ids -> {"none", "free", "claimed", "done"}]
  \* Each unit has one of three outcomes.
  /\ outcome \in [Ids -> {"none", "landed", "released"}]
  \* Waiter lists are sets of queues.
  /\ waiters \in [Ids -> SUBSET Threads]
  \* SHUT flags are booleans.
  /\ shut \in [Ids -> BOOLEAN]
  \* Inboxes are sequences of notes.
  /\ \A q \in Threads : \A i \in 1..Len(inbox[q]) : inbox[q][i] \in Msg
  \* Taken notes are notes too.
  /\ \A q \in Threads : \A i \in 1..Len(taken[q]) : taken[q][i] \in Msg
  \* Waits have one of three values.
  /\ slot \in [Threads -> [Things -> {"none", "pending", "ready"}]]
  \* Owners are busy or idle.
  /\ own \in [Threads -> {"busy", "idle"}]
  \* Each round has a unit, or none yet.
  /\ roundUnit \in [Rounds -> Ids \cup {NoUnit}]
  \* Synced and visible rounds are rounds.
  /\ synced \subseteq Rounds /\ visible \subseteq Rounds
  \* Stalls in force are stalls.
  /\ stalled \subseteq Stalls
  \* Stopped writes are in one of three places.
  /\ spc \in [Threads -> [Stalls -> {"none", "seen", "recheck"}]]
  \* The waits an owner holds are timed waits.
  /\ timed \in [Threads -> SUBSET Timers]
  \* The waits that are due are timed waits.
  /\ elapsed \subseteq Timers
  \* The dropped queues are threads' queues.
  /\ dropped \subseteq Threads

\* A unit's disk read runs at most once: one claim, one run.
\* Rules out: A and B both claiming block 7's unit and reading it twice.
SingleRun == \A u \in Ids : runs[u] <= 1

\* A queue is given at most one "done" note per unit, and only if it
\* registered on that unit.
\* Rules out: B being told twice, or C being told about a read it never
\* asked for.
ExactlyOnce ==
  \* For every queue and unit:
  \A q \in Threads, u \in Ids :
    \* at most one note...
    /\ told[q][u] <= 1
    \* ...and only to a queue that registered.
    /\ told[q][u] = 1 => q \in regd[u]

\* Once a finished unit has told everyone it owed, every queue that
\* registered got its note.
\* Rules out: B registering on block 7's unit and never hearing it finished.
EveryWaiterTold ==
  \* For every unit that ended and has nobody left to tell:
  \A u \in Ids : (state[u] = "done" /\ toTell[u] = {}) =>
    \* each queue that registered got exactly one note.
    \A q \in regd[u] : told[q][u] = 1

\* A read's request sits only on its own thread's queue, so only that
\* queue's poll can ever finish it.
\* Rules out: A's read recorded on B's queue, finished by B's poll on B's
\* thread, while A never hears.
OwnQueue ==
  \* In every queue's inbox and taken notes...
  \A q \in Threads :
    \* every "read" note in the inbox is from q's own reader...
    /\ \A i \in 1..Len(inbox[q]) : inbox[q][i].kind = "read" => inbox[q][i].reader = q
    \* ...and so is every one being handled.
    /\ \A i \in 1..Len(taken[q]) : taken[q][i].kind = "read" => taken[q][i].reader = q

\* An idle owner that nobody has woken has an empty inbox.
\* Rules out: B going to sleep right as A's "done" note lands, sleeping
\* forever with the note unread.
NoLostIdleWakeup ==
  \* For every thread: asleep and not woken means nothing in the inbox.
  \A t \in Threads : (own[t] = "idle" /\ ~woken[t]) => inbox[t] = <<>>

\* Only an idle owner is ever woken.
\* Rules out: a note waking A while A is busy running its own reads.
BusyNeverWoken ==
  \* For every thread: a fired waker means the thread was asleep.
  \A t \in Threads : woken[t] => own[t] = "idle"

\* Every free unit in the table is held by some queue (registered there, or
\* on its way in a "read" note), so some poll will run it.
\* Rules out: a job started with no queue, which no poll ever runs.
NoOrphanUnit ==
  \* For every block or job:
  \A x \in Things :
    \* If the table holds a free unit for x...
    (table[x] # NoUnit /\ state[table[x]] = "free") =>
      \* ...some queue holds it.
      Held(table[x])

\* A round's commits are visible only once its fsync ran: an Immediate
\* commit a reader saw survives a power cut.
\* Rules out: the commits of round 4 visible as soon as they are written,
\* before the fsync a queue's poll will run.
VisibleAfterSync == visible \subseteq synced

\* A ticket (any wait) becomes ready only at its own thread's poll: no
\* other thread's step makes it ready.
\* Rules out: B running round 4 and making A's ticket ready on B's thread,
\* running A's callbacks there, while A is busy.
DeliveredOnOwnPoll == offPoll = {}

\* A cleared stall leaves no unlanded unit behind, except one a writer is
\* about to land on its second look.
\* Rules out: the clearer looking before the writer installed its unit, and
\* the writer never looking again, so its write waits forever.
StallLandsWhenClear ==
  \* For every stall:
  \A s \in Stalls :
    \* If it cleared and the table still holds an unlanded unit for it...
    (s \notin stalled /\ table[s] # NoUnit /\ state[table[s]] = "free") =>
      \* ...some writer has registered and is about to look again.
      \E t \in Threads : spc[t][s] = "recheck"

\* A timed wait's note and its record sit only on the queue of the thread
\* that asked for it, so only that thread's poll completes it.
\* Rules out: A's backoff recorded on B's queue and ended by B's poll, on
\* B's thread.
TimerOnOwnQueue ==
  \* On every queue:
  \A q \in Threads :
    \* every "timer" note in the inbox is for a wait of q's own thread...
    /\ \A i \in 1..Len(inbox[q]) : inbox[q][i].kind = "timer" => TimerOf[inbox[q][i].u] = q
    \* ...so is every one being handled...
    /\ \A i \in 1..Len(taken[q]) : taken[q][i].kind = "timer" => TimerOf[taken[q][i].u] = q
    \* ...and so is every wait the owner holds.
    /\ \A x \in timed[q] : TimerOf[x] = q

\* A timed wait is ready only once the clock reached its due time, or its
\* queue is gone.
\* Rules out: a retry that asked to wait until its due time running again
\* at the very next poll.
TimerNotEarly ==
  \* For every timed wait:
  \A x \in Timers :
    \* ready means due, or dropped with its queue.
    slot[TimerOf[x]][x] = "ready" => (x \in elapsed \/ TimerOf[x] \in dropped)

\* A dropped queue holds no timed wait and leaves none pending.
\* Rules out: a task waiting for ever on a wait whose queue is gone, which
\* no poll will ever look at.
DroppedHoldsNothing ==
  \* For every dropped queue:
  \A t \in dropped :
    \* the owner holds no wait...
    /\ timed[t] = {}
    \* ...and no timed wait of its thread is still pending.
    /\ \A x \in Timers : slot[t][x] # "pending"

\* Over a whole run: every thread's reads, jobs, commits, writes and timed
\* waits all finish. With one thread this is the wasm case: it finishes
\* everything by itself.
AllDone == <>(\A t \in Threads : done[t] = Goal(t))

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* THE SETUPS THE CONFIGURATIONS NAME

\* Two threads: thread 1 reads blocks 1 and 2, thread 2 reads block 1 (the
\* block both miss; block 2 is thread 1's alone).

\* Job 3 belongs to thread 2.
JobOfJobs == [j \in {3} |-> 2]

\* One thread reads block 1 alone.
WantSingleOne == [t \in {1} |-> {1}]
\* One thread reads both blocks and starts the job itself.
WantSingle == [t \in {1} |-> {1, 2}]

\* Round 4 covers a commit of thread 1 and one of thread 2.
CommittersBoth == [r \in {4} |-> {1, 2}]
\* Stall 5 stops writes on threads 1 and 2.
StoppedBoth == [s \in {5} |-> {1, 2}]
\* No timed waits in a setup.
TimerOfNone == [x \in {} |-> 1]
\* Timed wait 6 is thread 1's.
