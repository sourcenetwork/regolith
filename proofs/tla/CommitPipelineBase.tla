---- MODULE CommitPipelineBase ----
\* The lock-free commit pipeline: what a configuration chooses, the state
\* of the pipeline and of each thread in it, and the small questions the
\* steps ask about that state. The steps themselves are in
\* CommitPipelineSteps.tla, and what must be true of them, with the whole
\* story of the model, in CommitPipeline.tla.

\* The model counts with whole numbers and asks how big a set is.
EXTENDS Naturals, FiniteSets

\* What a configuration chooses.
CONSTANTS
  \* The threads that commit one transaction each: positive numbers.
  Committers,
  \* The committers that are plain writes (Db::put, Db::write): no
  \* snapshot, no validation, they always land. The rest are transactions.
  Plain,
  \* The transactions that begin as a step of their own, before they
  \* commit, so that other commits can land in between. The others begin
  \* at the moment they commit.
  EarlyBegin,
  \* The threads that ask for one ordered unit each (an ingest, say).
  Units,
  \* Which keys each thread writes, as a function from thread to key set.
  \* A transaction that writes none only reads: it is checked like any
  \* other, and takes no sequence and no record.
  Writes,
  \* Which keys each transaction read and asks to have checked.
  Reads,
  \* The committers who wait until their record is on stable storage.
  Immediate,
  \* The most tickets the machine hands out in this run.
  MaxSlots,
  \* How many threads may walk away for good...
  MaxStops,
  \* ...and which threads those may be.
  Stoppers,
  \* The thread that pulls the first ticket of the run; 0 for whichever
  \* gets there first.
  Head,
  \* How many times the log may fail (a write or a sync).
  MaxFails,
  \* How many commits the memtable holds before it is rotated.
  Buffer,
  \* Whether steps nothing can fall between are taken in one go.
  Coarse,
  \* Whether writing a record is shown step by step, as the code does it
  \* (write_unit.rs): the owner fills its record, one thread at a time
  \* holds the write unit and writes a run of filled records with one
  \* write, the others park on their record, and a thread whose patience
  \* ran out writes its record itself, as a copy. Each write is counted in
  \* at the log's gate and then lands, two steps, so a copy can be in
  \* flight beside a run (WG4). FALSE: a record is written in one step, by
  \* whichever thread may: the rows about deciding, publishing and rolling
  \* back need no more than that.
  Copies,
  \* Whether a parked writer gives up after a while and writes its record
  \* itself (write_unit.rs, PATIENCE): TRUE, as the code does. FALSE takes
  \* the time out away, so a thread waits only for somebody to wake it; a
  \* wake that never comes then leaves it asleep for good, and the run says
  \* so (NoLiveThreadBlocked). That is how a row checks no wake is ever
  \* lost.
  Patience,
  \* How many slots past the next one to decide a blocking thread's own slot
  \* must be before it parks far from its turn rather than wait on the
  \* thread deciding (pipeline.rs, P6, the lead). 0: any thread whose slot
  \* is not the next one may park.
  Lead,
  \* Which rule is deliberately broken; "none" is the real design.
  Mutant

\* Everybody who takes a ticket.

  fails,
  \* Where each thread is in its own commit: "idle" (not started), "open"

  \* ticket with no order on it), "ready" (its order is in the ring),

  stopped,

  wanted,
  \* Whether somebody claimed the encoding of each order's record and has
  \* not finished it (descriptor.rs, the FILLING flag).
  filling,
  \* The record each thread is encoding now; 0 for none (write_unit.rs,
  \* RegolithEngine::fill, on the owner's thread or on a thread that needs
  \* the record written and found nobody encoding it).
  encoding,
  \* The last record of the last run each thread wrote; 0 for none. The

  \* (pipeline.rs, publish_ready, WU7).
  runEnd,
  \* The threads parked far from their turn (pipeline.rs, park_far, P6).
  turnAsleep,
  \* The next slot to decide when each thread last parked far from its
  \* turn: a thread parks at most once while the frontier stands still,
  \* then helps; 0 for never.
  turnAt,
  \* Every order up to this one has its turn near: the decided frontier
  \* named it while somebody slept far from its turn (pipeline.rs, near_to).
  nearTo,
  \* Every order up to this one was told so by a finished commit
  \* (pipeline.rs, woken_to).
  wokenTo,

Usable(j) == Brings(j) /\ ~failed[j] /\ ~wr[j] /\ filled[j] /\ ep[j] = logEp

\* The run that starts at order f and looks no further than order top: f
\* and every later record while each one is usable. An order with no
\* record (an abort, a thrown-away ticket, a unit) takes no bytes in the
\* log and is passed over; a record that is not usable ends the run, since
\* the next one's bytes no longer follow on (Run::take).
RunFrom(f, top) == {j \in f..top : Brings(j) /\ \A k \in f..j : Brings(k) => Usable(k)}

\* The first record a run may start with: the first usable one past the
\* published frontier, up to order top. The ones before it are skipped,
\* written already or not filled yet.
Firsts(top) == {j \in (pub + 1)..top : Usable(j)}

\* What a run keeps once it counted in at the gate and looked at its
\* records again (write_unit.rs, WU3): the records before the first one
\* that is now written or thrown out. Mutant GatherBeforeCountIn keeps
\* what it gathered, as if what it saw before it counted in still held.
Kept(run) ==
  \* The broken version does not look again.
  IF Mutant = "GatherBeforeCountIn" THEN run
  \* The real one: every record with no written or thrown-out one at or
  \* before it.
  ELSE {j \in run : \A k \in run : k <= j => ~wr[k] /\ ~failed[k]}

\* Thread a may publish order p because its last run wrote that far: the
\* holder publishes what its run made publishable before it wakes the
\* run's owners (pipeline.rs, publish_ready, WU7). Publishing an order that
\* may be finished is safe whoever does it; this is the one way a thread
\* publishes past its own order.
PublishesRun(a, p) ==
  \* Only in the runs that show writes step by step...
  /\ Copies
  \* ...by a thread that is here, not asleep, not about to copy...
  /\ Live(a) /\ a \notin asleep /\ a \notin turnAsleep /\ late[a] = 0
  \* ...and the order is at or before the end of its last run.
  /\ p <= runEnd[a]

\* How far the turn is near once the decided frontier passes order i: the
\* pass names order i + Lead, but only while somebody sleeps far from its
\* turn (pipeline.rs, pass_decided: near_to.fetch_max when far is not 0).
Named(i) == IF turnAsleep # {} /\ i + Lead > nearTo THEN i + Lead ELSE nearTo
