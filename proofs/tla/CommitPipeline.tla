---- MODULE CommitPipeline ----
\* The lock-free commit pipeline as built (plan 4.7; src/engine/commit).
\*
\* THE PICTURE. Think of a bakery with a ticket machine. Every customer (a
\* commit) pulls a numbered ticket (a slot of the ring). Orders are handled
\* strictly in ticket order, but by whoever is standing at the counter: any
\* customer may do the next step of any order ahead of their own. So a
\* customer who wanders off never holds the queue up: the next one finishes
\* their order for them, or throws their unused ticket away.
\*
\* PROVED FOR EVERY SIZE in Lean, proofs/lean/Regolith/Pipeline.lean:
\*   seqs_dense, seqs_strictly_increasing
\*       NoHole, SeqInRingOrder.
\*   publication_order, reader_sees_published
\*       PublishedPrefix, ReadersSeePrefix.
\*   rollback_as_if_never_decided
\*       NoHole across a rollback: the sequences are the ones the kept and
\*       the later slots would have taken had the discarded ones never
\*       been decided.
\*   rollback_keeps_published, rollback_finishes_everything
\*       a rollback touches nothing published and leaves nothing waiting
\*       (G2, PublishedPrefix).
\*   sync_covers_only_written
\*       DurableImpliesWritten.
\* In proofs/lean/Regolith/PipelineHelping.lean:
\*   first_unfinished_can_step, helper_alone_finishes, no_step_goes_back,
\*   helping_is_bounded
\*       the safety half of lock-freedom: every ordering rule looks only at
\*       earlier slots, so the first unfinished slot always has a step any
\*       thread at or behind it may take; no step of any thread undoes
\*       another's; so one live thread alone finishes every slot up to its
\*       own in a bounded number of its own steps (E21), wherever the
\*       others stopped.
\*   held_round_blocks
\*       the stated limit: a thread that stops holding the round stops the
\*       commits that wait for the sync (RED StopHoldsClaim).
\* And in Regolith/PipelineCheck.lean, the check a slot runs when it is
\* decided:
\*   landed_write_is_seen, no_lost_update, later_slot_aborts
\*       a write that landed is in the store every later slot is checked
\*       against, since a slot is in the memtable before the next is
\*       decided; so a later transaction that touched its key from an older
\*       snapshot aborts, whatever slots stand between them (NoLostUpdate).
\*   abort_has_cause
\*       a slot aborts only when it is a transaction and the store holds a
\*       newer version of a key it touched (AbortsHaveCause).
\*   conflict_stays
\*       a conflict found among some versions is still one when more land,
\*       which is why an early conflict aborts at once (EarlyAbort).
\*   early_check_split, early_check_cover
\*       checking up to a horizon on the committer's own thread and above
\*       it when the slot is decided equals one check (NoLostUpdate,
\*       AbortsHaveCause).
\*   store_below_ceiling, ceiling_skips_the_check_above
\*       no version is newer than the last sequence handed out, so when
\*       that is at or below the horizon the look above it finds nothing
\*       and is skipped (SkipsCheck, Loses).
\*   published_only_loses_an_update, skip_on_published_loses_an_update
\*       RED ValidatePublished and RED SkipOnPublished as concrete
\*       counterexamples.
\* The other half of lock-freedom, that the interleavings of several
\* threads keep finishing slots (LockFree, EveryLiveCommitCompletes), is
\* checked here by TLC, on small instances.
\*
\* THE CODE, step by step, and the action that stands for each step.
\*   Begin, EarlyAbort
\*               Transaction::begin, and RegolithEngine::check_early
\*               (early.rs): before it takes a slot a transaction samples
\*               the read horizon and checks itself, on its own thread,
\*               against everything visible up to it; a conflict there
\*               aborts it at once. Whichever thread decides its slot then
\*               looks only above that horizon (Conflict), and not at all
\*               when nothing was handed a sequence above it (SkipsCheck).
\*   Reserve     Ring::reserve, one fetch_add on the tail.
\*   Fill        Ring::install, one compare-and-swap of the cell's stamp.
\*   Void        Ring::void by a helper that reaches a reserved cell with
\*               nothing in it; the owner's install then fails (Retry).
\*   ReadTip, DecideCas
\*               RegolithEngine::decide: read the tip (the state after the
\*               newest decided slot), check the slot is next, compute the
\*               decision, install it with one compare-and-swap
\*               (Descriptor::decide). An abort takes nothing. "Abort" here
\*               is every decision that lands nothing: a lost conflict, a
\*               dropped column family (the fence), a database that is
\*               closed, a validation read that would block (R11).
\*   Apply, TipMove, MarkStale, Pass
\*               RegolithEngine::settle: apply the slot to its memtable,
\*               move the tip to its decision, pass the decided frontier. A
\*               decision whose epoch is not the tip's is stale: its slot is
\*               failed instead.
\*   Write, WriteFail
\*               the record reaches the log in one step, by whichever
\*               thread may write it, behind the log's epoch gate: the rows
\*               that leave Copies unset show the write no finer than that.
\*               A failed write poisons the log.
\*   Encode, Gather, RunStart, WriteLand, Release, Park, Timeout,
\*   StealStart, WriteStart, LandFail
\*               the write as the code makes it, in the rows that set
\*               Copies (write_unit.rs, the write unit; the table at the
\*               end of this header names the line of code for each).
\*               Each owner encodes its own record (Encode). One thread at a
\*               time holds the write unit: it gathers the run of filled
\*               records that waits first (Gather), counts in at the gate
\*               and looks at them again (RunStart), writes them with one
\*               write that lands (WriteLand) or fails (LandFail), and lets
\*               the unit go, waking the first thread still waiting for it
\*               (Release). A thread whose record is in another's hands
\*               parks on it (Park), and is woken by whoever writes, fills
\*               or fails it; or its patience runs out (Timeout) and it
\*               writes the record itself, as a copy, counted in at the
\*               gate and looked at again first (StealStart). The round's
\*               holder copies what it needs without waiting (WriteStart).
\*               A sync waits for the writes in flight below what it
\*               vouches for before it begins, and so does a unit before
\*               it syncs, since a sector in flight when the power goes may
\*               come back garbled whatever was being written to it
\*               (wal_gate.rs, WG4; NoWriteUnderSync).
\*   ClaimRound, SyncBegin, SyncOk, SyncFail
\*               round.rs: the round is one claim on the log's device step.
\*               Whoever claims it syncs the written prefix.
\*   RbFreeze, RbFinish
\*               ordered.rs roll_back, run by the thread that holds the
\*               round when the log is poisoned: freeze the frontiers, move
\*               to a new epoch, publish what is publishable, fail the rest,
\*               cut the log, replace the memtable, thaw.
\*   PubHorizon, PubFrontier
\*               publish_upto: raise the read horizon, then pass the
\*               published frontier.
\*   ClaimNext, UnitRun, TurnRun
\*               ordered.rs: an ordered unit (an ingest's install, a column
\*               family's create or drop, a close) takes a slot, and the
\*               rotation check takes the turn of the write that finds the
\*               memtable full. Either is a job claimed with one
\*               compare-and-swap by whichever thread reaches the slot, and
\*               runs with everything before it published.
\*
\* WHAT IS NOT A STOPPED THREAD. A thread that holds the round, or that
\* claimed an ordered unit, is taken to be at work on the device (an fsync,
\* a truncate, a flush, a new log file), and the model never stops it
\* there. This is a limit of the code and not only of the model: between
\* its claim and its end such a thread also runs ordinary code, and a
\* thread descheduled for good in that window holds up every commit that
\* needs the round or stands behind the unit. The RED StopHoldsClaim shows
\* exactly that. Nor does the model stop a thread whose write is in flight
\* (counted in at the gate): those bytes are with the host, which finishes
\* the write. Everywhere else a thread may stop for good, and that
\* includes the holder of the write unit with a run gathered: the others'
\* patience runs out and they write their records themselves
\* (MC_CommitPipeline_Green_Copies_Stop).
\*
\* SMALL STEPS AND ONE-GO STEPS. Deciding an order is four steps in the
\* code (install the verdict, apply, move the tip, pass the frontier) and
\* publishing it is two (horizon, frontier). Whatever another thread does
\* between two of those steps it could as well have done before the first
\* or after the last, and come out the same, with one exception: a
\* rollback, which may fall between any two of them. So a configuration may
\* set Coarse: the steps are then taken one by one for as long as a rollback
\* can still happen (the log may still fail, or a failure is being dealt
\* with), and in one go otherwise. With Coarse unset every step is always
\* taken on its own. The run that checks every invariant for three threads
\* and the runs of two threads leave it unset; the other runs of three set
\* it, which is what lets them finish in seconds. Each .cfg says which it
\* is, and what it gave up.
\*
\* WHAT THE MODEL LEAVES OUT, and why that loses nothing.
\*   - One sequence per commit, and a record's offset is its sequence: each
\*     decided commit takes one contiguous range of each, in the same order,
\*     so one number stands for both.
\*   - The ring's capacity. A reservation that finds its cell in use helps
\*     publish the slot a lap before, the same helping as here; indices here
\*     only grow, up to MaxSlots, and BoundNeverBinds checks the bound never
\*     stops a live thread.
\*   - The pins that keep a loaded descriptor alive, the parking on a job,
\*     and the two loads a decider makes around a rotation: loom models in
\*     src/engine/commit/loom_model.rs.
\*   - commit_nowait. Its commits take the same steps; where a blocking
\*     call waits for a round or a unit another thread claimed, such a
\*     commit leaves the job on its own queue and returns. The queue and
\*     the delivery of the completion are NonBlocking.tla.
\*   - Two threads writing one verdict at once. Both work it out from the
\*     same tip, so both write the same one, and one compare-and-swap
\*     keeps one; the model writes it once. The exception is a thread
\*     whose tip a rollback has since discarded, and that one the model
\*     has (ReadTip, DecideCas).
\*   - Recovery: WalRecovery.tla and Regolith/WalRecovery.lean.
\*
\* CONFIGURATIONS are listed with what each shows in the .cfg files.
\*
\* WHAT BECAME OF GroupCommit.tla. The pipeline replaced group commit (one
\* leader that held a mutex, took the waiting commits as a group, and handed
\* the mutex on). That model is retired with the code it described. Every
\* rule it checked is carried by a rule here, or in the model named, and
\* every RED row it had has a RED row that plants the same mistake in the
\* pipeline:
\*
\*   SerialEquivalent           -> NoLostUpdate and AbortsHaveCause.
\*     RED ViewOnly             -> Red_ValidatePublished (a slot checked
\*                                 against a view that lacks an earlier
\*                                 slot's writes), Red_PassBeforeApply_LostUpdate
\*     RED TrustEarly           -> Red_TrustEarly
\*     (new with the skip)      -> Red_SkipOnPublished: the skip asked of
\*                                 the published horizon, not the last
\*                                 sequence handed out

\*   SingleSync                 -> OneRound and DurableWithinDecided.
\*     RED DoubleClaim          -> Red_TwoSyncs, Red_TwoSyncs_Durable; for
\*                                 the claim of a job, NonBlocking.tla,
\*                                 SingleRun, MC_NonBlocking_Red_DoubleSync
\*   OwedBlocksNextGroup        -> no longer a rule: commits behind a sync
\*                                 that is owed are decided and written
\*                                 meanwhile. What it protected, that nothing
\*                                 is published past a commit still waiting
\*                                 for its sync, is ReadersSeePrefix and
\*                                 DurableBeforeVisible
\*   AllTicketsComplete         -> LockFree and EveryLiveCommitCompletes, in

\*                                 in the Rollback, Rotation, Early,

\*                                 Green_Rollback for a group that fails
\*   Green_LivePlain            -> MC_CommitPipeline_Green_Plain
\*   Green_ReadOnly             -> MC_CommitPipeline_Green_ReadOnly
\*   Green_Nowait, _NowaitLive  -> MC_NonBlocking_Green_Commit (the queue
\*                                 and the delivery), MC_Parking_Green (a
\*                                 poll that cannot go on) and
\*                                 MC_Landing_Green (who is told)
\*
\* The group's own device, checking a member against the view plus the keys
\* of the members accepted before it, is gone with the group: a slot is in
\* the memtable before the next one is decided (AppliedBeforePassed), so the
\* check reads the memtable itself.
\*
\* THE WRITE UNIT, LINE BY LINE. Every variable, step and promise of this
\* model about the write unit and about a thread parked far from its turn,
\* beside the Rust that does it, in plain words. (File and line of the tree
\* the model was checked against; the files are under src/engine.)
\*
\*   filled[i]: order i's record is encoded and will not change again. The
\*       FILLED flag, set by Descriptor::fill (commit/descriptor.rs:592), read by
\*       Descriptor::record (commit/descriptor.rs:610).
\*   filling[i], encoding[a]: somebody claimed the encoding of order i's
\*       record, and which record thread a has in hand. The FILLING flag
\*       (commit/descriptor.rs:356), claimed by the fetch_or at the top of
\*       Descriptor::fill; the encoding is the closure that call runs.
\*   writer: who holds the write unit. The CLAIMED bit of WriteUnit.word,
\*       taken by try_claim (commit/write_unit.rs:217) and let go by release
\*       (commit/write_unit.rs:237).
\*   gathered[a]: the run the holder collected. The Run that try_batch's scan
\*       fills (commit/write_unit.rs:826), record by record through Run::take
\*       (commit/write_unit.rs:407).
\*   fly[a]: a write counted in at the gate, its bytes on the way. InFlight
\*       (wal_log.rs:626), made by Log::count_in (wal_log.rs:417) and counted out
\*       when it drops (wal_log.rs:644).
\*   runEnd[a]: the last record of the run thread a wrote. wrote_upto in
\*       try_batch (commit/write_unit.rs:902).
\*   asleep, sleepOn[a]: a thread parked on a record. The thread on the
\*       descriptor's list with PARKED set: Descriptor::register
\*       (commit/descriptor.rs:657), then park (commit/descriptor.rs:640).
\*   late[a]: a parked thread whose patience ran out. out_of_patience answered
\*       yes (commit/write_unit.rs:610); copy_record comes next.
\*   wanted: a parked thread asked to be woken at the next let go. The WANTED
\*       bit, set by WriteUnit::note (commit/write_unit.rs:244) from park_on, read
\*       by the let go's swap.
\*   turnAsleep, turnAt[a]: threads parked far from their turn, and where the
\*       frontier stood when each last parked. Turns.far counts them
\*       (commit/turn_wait.rs:52); parked_at in help_decide
\*       (commit/pipeline.rs:345) is turnAt.
\*   nearTo, wokenTo: the orders named as near, and the orders told so.
\*       Turns.near_to and Turns.woken_to (commit/turn_wait.rs:54,
\*       commit/turn_wait.rs:56).
\*   nearMark[i]: order i was told its turn is near. The NEAR flag
\*       (commit/descriptor.rs:364), set by wake_near's mark
\*       (commit/pipeline.rs:794).
\*   owes[a]: thread a's commit is done and it still has to tell. drive's call
\*       of wake_near once publish_upto says Published (commit/pipeline.rs:1055).
\*   Lead: how far past the next order a thread's own must be before it parks
\*       far from its turn. Turns::lead (commit/turn_wait.rs:73): LEAD
\*       (commit/turn_wait.rs:41), and one more for every LEAD_PER_SLEEPER
\*       sleepers.
\*   Patience: a sleeper may give up waiting. PATIENCE for a record
\*       (commit/write_unit.rs:144), TURN_PATIENCE far from the turn
\*       (commit/turn_wait.rs:46).
\*
\*   EncodeStart(a, i), EncodeEnd(a): claim the encoding of a record nobody is
\*       encoding, encode it, set FILLED and wake the parked. RegolithEngine::fill
\*       (commit/write_unit.rs:516), called by drive (commit/pipeline.rs:1031) for
\*       the owner's own record, by the allocations (commit/allocate.rs:91), and
\*       by bring_written for a record a thread needs that nobody is encoding
\*       (commit/write_unit.rs:564); Descriptor::fill and its mark
\*       (commit/descriptor.rs:565).
\*   DirectStart(a): the fast path (WU8). An owner whose record nobody has in
\*       hand finds the unit free with no note on it, encodes its record and goes
\*       to write it by itself; StealStart then counts it in and looks again.
\*       RegolithEngine::write_alone (commit/write_unit.rs:710), called by drive
\*       and drive_nowait before the unit's way (commit/pipeline.rs:1011):
\*       WriteUnit::quiet (commit/write_unit.rs:211), one load; then fill and
\*       copy_record.
\*   Gather(a): claim the free unit and collect the first run. try_batch
\*       (commit/write_unit.rs:784): try_claim, then the scan from past the
\*       written hint or the published frontier, whichever is further.
\*   RunStart(a): count in, look again, keep what still waits.
\*       log.count_in(run.epoch) (commit/write_unit.rs:849), then the look again,
\*       which is Kept.
\*   WriteLand(a), a run: the run's one write lands. flight.write
\*       (commit/write_unit.rs:870) through InFlight::write (wal_log.rs:635),
\*       LogFile::write_all_vectored_at and its pwritev (../env/std_env.rs:477);
\*       then the count out and the marks, whose wakes come after the let go.
\*   WriteLand(a), a copy: copy_record (commit/write_unit.rs:728) through
\*       Log::write_unless (wal_log.rs:391), then Descriptor::mark, which wakes.
\*   LandFail(a): a write fails. The error arms of try_batch and copy_record:
\*       the log is poisoned and the parked are woken.
\*   Release(a): let the unit go and tell. Claim's drop
\*       (commit/write_unit.rs:975): WriteUnit::release, then tell_waiters
\*       (commit/write_unit.rs:933), which wakes the first record that
\*       waits_for_the_unit (commit/write_unit.rs:459) and asks again for the
\*       next.
\*   PubHorizon(a), PubFrontier(a) with PublishesRun(a, p): the holder
\*       publishes what its run made publishable before it wakes the run's owners
\*       (WU7). publish_ready (commit/pipeline.rs:925), called after the let go
\*       (commit/write_unit.rs:916); each order through publishable_slot and
\*       publish_slot (commit/pipeline.rs:902), as every publisher does.
\*   Park(a): sleep on a record in another's hands: filled and the unit
\*       claimed, or being encoded. park_on (commit/write_unit.rs:671):
\*       Descriptor::park, looking again whether the record is written, and for a
\*       filled record noting the claim it saw as wanted, for one being encoded
\*       whether it is filled now.
\*   CopyOwn(a): a commit that waits for a sync finds its own record in
\*       another's hands and copies it instead of sleeping on it. drive's
\*       bring_written with Await::Copy for an Immediate slot
\*       (commit/pipeline.rs:1045), the same path the round's holder takes.
\*   Timeout(a): the park's time runs out. park_timeout in Descriptor::park,
\*       and out_of_patience (commit/write_unit.rs:643) saying yes.
\*   StealStart(a): the copy after the patience. copy_record, through
\*       Log::write_unless: count in, look again (the `written` test), write.
\*   WriteStart(a, i): the round's holder copies. sync_written calls
\*       bring_written with Await::Copy (commit/round.rs:243).
\*   Need(a): the record a thread needs next. drive's bring_written of its own
\*       record (commit/pipeline.rs:1050), then publish_upto's of the next to
\*       publish (commit/pipeline.rs:886).
\*   Usable, RunFrom, Firsts: which records a run takes. The `usable` test of
\*       the scan and Run::take's same log, same epoch, offset that follows on.
\*   Pass, Void, DecideNow, UnitRun with Named(i): a frontier pass names the
\*       orders whose turn is now near. RegolithEngine::pass_decided
\*       (commit/pipeline.rs:774): Ring::pass_decided (commit/ring.rs:244), then
\*       Turns::name (commit/turn_wait.rs:79); the void path and the ordered units
\*       pass through the same function.
\*   RbFinish with Named: a rollback's jump names the orders past it.
\*       thaw_decided then Turns::name (commit/ordered.rs:790).
\*   TurnPark(a): a blocking thread far from its turn, finding the next order
\*       being decided by another (its DECIDING claim taken), parks on its own
\*       order. help_decide (commit/pipeline.rs:413), then park_far
\*       (commit/pipeline.rs:804): Turns::count_in (commit/turn_wait.rs:111),
\*       Descriptor::park with Turns::near (commit/turn_wait.rs:125) as its look.
\*   TurnWake(a): the sleeper wakes: NEAR set, or TURN_PATIENCE passed; then
\*       Turns::count_out and help_decide looks again.
\*   WakeNear(a): a finished commit tells the named orders. wake_near
\*       (commit/pipeline.rs:786): Turns::claim_told (commit/turn_wait.rs:92),
\*       then mark(NEAR) on each order in the ring.
\*   PubFrontier waking a told owner from turnAsleep: a blocking slot's
\*       landing wakes whoever parked on it. Descriptor::land

\*
\* RUST WITH NO STEP OF ITS OWN HERE, and why that loses nothing:
\*   - the spin before a park (commit/write_unit.rs:623) and its budget
\*     SPIN_BUDGET (commit/write_unit.rs:141), past which a waiter parks at
\*     once: a wait that ends by itself changes nothing, and which waiters
\*     spin first changes nothing either;
\*   - the written hint WriteUnit.written (commit/write_unit.rs:163): it only
\*     skips records that are written, which the model's scan passes over too;
\*   - the run's caps MAX_BATCH_RECORDS and MAX_BATCH_BYTES
\*     (commit/write_unit.rs:130): a run that stops early is a run whose next
\*     record is not usable, which the model has;
\*   - the logical ends of a park (FRONTIER_PATIENCE, the ring full): more
\*     ways for Timeout to happen, which may happen at any time anyway;
\*   - the lead growing with the sleepers (LEAD_PER_SLEEPER): a larger lead
\*     only names orders sooner; the rows take Lead as a constant, 1 where a
\*     thread must be told and 0 where parks happen as eagerly as can be and
\*     patience wakes them;
\*   - a turn sleeper woken by its record filled or written, or by its slot
\*     failed: wakes the model leaves out, so it shows that the ones it keeps
\*     are enough;
\*   - parked_at belongs to one call of help_decide, turnAt to the thread: a
\*     thread that leaves help_decide for a unit and comes back may park once
\*     more in the code, which only patience in the model would allow; such a
\*     park is bounded the same way (a_turn_park_is_bounded);
\*   - the round's holder may encode a record nobody is encoding before it
\*     copies it (bring_written with Await::Copy): its copy in the model needs
\*     no fill;
\*   - the line job of a commit_nowait commit (queue_on, tell_line):
\*     commit_nowait is not in this model (see WHAT THE MODEL LEAVES OUT); its
\*     handshake is the loom model
\*     a_queued_commit_is_told_when_the_unit_is_let_go.
\* MODEL WITH NO RUST: none. Every step and variable above is code.
\*
\* THE MODEL IS IN THREE MODULES, each small enough to read in one go:
\*   CommitPipelineBase.tla   what a configuration chooses, the state, and
\*                            the small questions the steps ask;
\*   CommitPipelineSteps.tla  the steps, one action each;
\*   CommitPipeline.tla       this one: what must be true of them.

\* The state, the helpers and the steps.
EXTENDS CommitPipelineSteps

\* Invariants: what is true in every reachable state.

\* Every variable holds the kind of thing its comment says.
TypeOK ==
  \* The tail is a ticket number or zero.
  /\ tail \in 0..MaxSlots
  \* Cells hold one of the four states.
  /\ cell \in [Slots -> {"free", "claimed", "ready", "void"}]
  \* Owners are threads, or nobody.
  /\ owner \in [Slots -> Actors \cup {0}]
  \* Verdicts are one of the four.
  /\ dec \in [Slots -> {"none", "commit", "abort", "unit"}]
  \* Sequences and epochs are numbers...
  /\ sq \in [Slots -> Nat] /\ ep \in [Slots -> Nat]
  \* ...and so are log generations and memtable numbers.
  /\ logOf \in [Slots -> Nat] /\ memOf \in [Slots -> Nat]
  \* The three flags are yes or no.
  /\ ap \in [Slots -> BOOLEAN] /\ wr \in [Slots -> BOOLEAN] /\ failed \in [Slots -> BOOLEAN]
  \* The frontiers lie within the tickets handed out, published behind decided.
  /\ dto \in 0..tail /\ pub \in 0..dto /\ tipIdx \in 0..tail
  \* The switches are yes or no.
  /\ frozen \in BOOLEAN /\ poisoned \in BOOLEAN
  \* The round's holders are threads, and so is a claimant.
  /\ round \subseteq Actors /\ claimant \in Actors \cup {0}
  \* A sync's promise is a sequence, or zero for none.
  /\ target \in [Actors -> Nat]
  \* Every thread is at a known point.
  /\ pc \in [Actors -> {"idle", "open", "begun", "claimed", "ready", "done", "failed", "aborted"}]
  \* The stopped are threads.
  /\ stopped \subseteq Actors
  \* The writes in flight are sets of orders: one for a copy, several for
  \* a run.
  /\ fly \in [Actors -> SUBSET Slots]
  \* A record is filled or not.
  /\ filled \in [Slots -> BOOLEAN]
  \* The write unit is a thread's, or nobody's.
  /\ writer \in Actors \cup {0}
  \* A gathered run is a set of orders.
  /\ gathered \in [Actors -> SUBSET Slots]
  \* The parked are threads...
  /\ asleep \subseteq Actors
  \* ...each on a record, or 0.
  /\ sleepOn \in [Actors -> 0..MaxSlots]
  \* A thread out of patience names the record it will write, or 0.
  /\ late \in [Actors -> 0..MaxSlots]
  \* The request to be woken at the next claim is yes or no.
  /\ wanted \in BOOLEAN
  \* An encoding claim is yes or no for each record...
  /\ filling \in [Slots -> BOOLEAN]
  \* ...and a thread has one record in hand, or none.
  /\ encoding \in [Actors -> 0..MaxSlots]
  \* A run's end is an order, or 0.

  \* The threads parked far from their turn are threads...
  /\ turnAsleep \subseteq Actors
  \* ...each remembering where the frontier stood, or 0.
  /\ turnAt \in [Actors -> 0..(MaxSlots + 1)]
  \* The orders named and told are ticket numbers, or 0, or up to Lead past

  /\ nearTo \in 0..(MaxSlots + Lead) /\ wokenTo \in 0..(MaxSlots + Lead)
  \* Each order is marked near or not...
  /\ nearMark \in [Slots -> BOOLEAN]
  \* ...and each thread owes a telling or not.
  /\ owes \in [Actors -> BOOLEAN]
  \* A cell is free exactly when its ticket has not been handed out.
  /\ \A i \in Slots : (i <= tail) <=> cell[i] # "free"

\* R1, one fate per ticket: an owner who believes its order is in the ring
\* is right. Fails under VoidNotCas.
OwnerSeesItsFate ==
  \* Every thread that takes its order to be in the ring finds it there.
  \A a \in Actors : pc[a] \in {"ready", "done", "failed"} => cell[mine[a]] = "ready"

\* One thread at a time on the log's device step.
OneRound == Cardinality(round) <= 1

\* Orders are settled in ticket order: everything up to the frontier has a
\* verdict or was thrown away, and nothing beyond the next order has one.
DecidedIsPrefix ==
  \* Up to the frontier, settled.
  /\ \A i \in 1..dto : cell[i] = "void" \/ dec[i] # "none"
  \* Beyond the next order, untouched.
  /\ \A i \in Slots : i > dto + 1 => dec[i] = "none"
  \* The tip is never more than one order ahead of the frontier.
  /\ tipIdx <= dto + 1

\* No hole: the sequences held by the orders the tip covers are exactly
\* 1, 2, ..., up to the last one handed out, and only an order that landed
\* holds one. An abort, a thrown-away ticket and a thrown-out order hold
\* none. Fails under AbortHole, SettleAnyEpoch and NoFreeze.
NoHole ==
  \* The sequences that count are exactly 1..tipNext.
  /\ {sq[i] : i \in {j \in 1..tipIdx : Takes(j)}} = 1..tipNext
  \* Only a commit or a unit holds a sequence that counts.
  /\ \A i \in 1..tipIdx : Takes(i) => dec[i] \in {"commit", "unit"}

\* Sequence order is ticket order.
SeqInRingOrder ==
  \* Of two orders that count, the earlier ticket holds the smaller sequence.
  \A i, j \in 1..tipIdx : i < j /\ Takes(i) /\ Takes(j) => sq[i] < sq[j]

\* P2: an order the line has moved past that landed is in the memtable, so
\* the order after it was checked against it. Fails under PassBeforeApply.
AppliedBeforePassed ==
  \* Every order behind the frontier that landed and counts is in the memtable.
  \A i \in 1..dto : (Brings(i) \/ dec[i] = "unit") /\ ~failed[i] => InMem(i)

\* Outside a rollback, the memtable readers are shown holds no order that
\* was thrown out. Fails under KeepMemtable.
MemtableOnlyLive == rbLast = 0 => \A i \in Slots : InMem(i) => ~failed[i]

\* The same for the log: no record of a thrown-out order. Fails under
\* NoEpochGate.
RecordsAreLive == rbLast = 0 => \A i \in Slots : wr[i] => ~failed[i]

\* Everything behind the published frontier is settled and was allowed to
\* be finished. Fails under RollbackForgets.
PublishedPrefix == \A i \in 1..pub : Publishable(i)

\* P3: an order behind the published frontier is visible. Its owner, told
\* it is finished, reads its own write. Fails under FrontierFirst.
PublishedIsVisible == \A i \in 1..pub : Takes(i) => sq[i] <= visible

\* No reader sees a later order without every earlier one: whatever the
\* horizon covers is in the memtable, is the next order to finish at most,
\* and was allowed to be finished. Fails under OutOfOrder.
ReadersSeePrefix ==
  \* For every order that counts and that the horizon covers:
  \A i \in 1..tipIdx : Takes(i) /\ sq[i] <= visible =>
    \* Its writes are there to be read.
    /\ InMem(i)
    \* It is finished, or the very next to be.
    /\ i <= pub + 1
    \* And it met the conditions for finishing.
    /\ Publishable(i)

\* What the durable mark covers is written. Fails under SyncPastGap,
\* TwoSyncs and UnitNoDrain.
DurableImpliesWritten ==
  \* Every commit the durable mark covers has its record written.
  \A i \in 1..tipIdx : Takes(i) /\ dec[i] = "commit" /\ sq[i] <= durable => wr[i]

\* The durable mark never passes the last sequence handed out: a rollback
\* hands back no sequence a sync vouched for. Fails under TwoSyncs.
DurableWithinDecided == durable <= tipNext

\* At Immediate, visible only once durable.
DurableBeforeVisible ==
  \* For every order the tip covers:
  \A i \in 1..tipIdx :
    \* a commit that asked to wait for the disk and is visible is durable.
    Takes(i) /\ dec[i] = "commit" /\ owner[i] \in Immediate /\ sq[i] <= visible => sq[i] <= durable

\* No lost update: a transaction that commits read no key an earlier
\* landed order wrote after it began reading. Of two transactions that
\* read and write one key from the same snapshot, at most one commits.
\* Fails under ValidatePublished, PassBeforeApply and TrustEarly.
NoLostUpdate ==
  \* For every two orders the tip covers:
  \A i, j \in 1..tipIdx :
    \* Two orders in ticket order...
    /\ i < j
    \* ...the earlier one landed and counts...
    /\ Takes(i)
    \* ...the later one a transaction that committed and counts...
    /\ dec[j] = "commit" /\ ~failed[j] /\ owner[j] \in Committers \ Plain
    \* ...and read a key the earlier one wrote.
    /\ Writes[owner[i]] \cap Reads[owner[j]] # {}
    \* Then the later one began reading after the earlier one landed.
    => sq[i] <= snap[owner[j]]

\* No transaction is turned away for nothing: one that aborted, in its
\* slot or at its early check, lost to an order that landed after it began
\* reading and wrote a key it read. With NoLostUpdate this says the
\* pipeline decides each transaction as committing them one at a time, in
\* sequence order, would.
AbortsHaveCause ==
  \* An abort decided in a slot that still counts...
  /\ \A i \in 1..tipIdx : dec[i] = "abort" /\ ~failed[i] =>
       \* ...has an earlier order that landed...
       \E j \in 1..(i - 1) : /\ Takes(j)
                              \* ...after its transaction began reading...
                              /\ sq[j] > snap[owner[i]]
                              \* ...on a key it read.
                              /\ Writes[owner[j]] \cap Reads[owner[i]] # {}
  \* An abort at the early check...
  /\ \A a \in Actors : pc[a] = "aborted" =>
       \* ...has an order that landed...
       \E j \in 1..tipIdx : /\ Takes(j)
                             \* ...after the transaction began reading...
                             /\ sq[j] > snap[a]
                             \* ...on a key it read.
                             /\ Writes[owner[j]] \cap Reads[a] # {}

\* A rotation runs alone: a commit still in flight belongs to the log that
\* is current, so a rotation never leaves a record to be written in a log
\* it sealed. Fails under UnitNoDrain.
InFlightInCurrentLog ==
  \* Every unfinished commit that counts belongs to the log that is current.
  \A i \in 1..tipIdx : i > pub /\ Brings(i) /\ ~failed[i] => logOf[i] = gen

\* G2: nobody is told "done" for an order that was thrown out, nobody is
\* told "failed" for one that landed, and a commit told "done" has its
\* record in the log.
NoFalseAck ==
  \* For every thread, what it was told is true:
  \A a \in Actors :
    \* "done" means the order counts...
    /\ (pc[a] = "done" => ~failed[mine[a]])
    \* ...and, if it committed with writes, that its record is written.
    /\ (pc[a] = "done" /\ Brings(mine[a]) => wr[mine[a]])
    \* "failed" means it was thrown out.
    /\ (pc[a] = "failed" => failed[mine[a]])

\* E21, bounded work: a thread works out a verdict only for orders up to
\* its own, so no caller does the work of an unbounded line of others. Rules
\* out: thread 1's order is decided and waits for its sync; meanwhile thread
\* 1 goes on deciding the orders that keep arriving behind it, and its call
\* returns only when nobody commits any more. Fails under WorkBeyond. Lean:
\* helping_is_bounded (Regolith/PipelineHelping.lean).
WorksUpToItsOwn ==
  \* A thread's note names a ticket at or before its own.
  \A a \in Actors : seen[a] # NoNote => seen[a][1] <= mine[a]

\* A note is only ever for an order with no verdict: the others were used
\* up when the verdict was written.
NotesAreForUndecided ==
  \* The ticket a note names has no verdict.
  \A a \in Actors : seen[a] # NoNote => dec[seen[a][1]] = "none"

\* No live thread is ever stuck: when no live thread can take a step,
\* every live thread's call has returned. Fails under NoHelping and
\* StopHoldsClaim.
NoLiveThreadBlocked ==
  \* With no step left for any live thread, each of them has its answer.
  (~ENABLED LiveNext) => \A a \in Actors \ stopped : pc[a] \in {"done", "failed", "aborted"}
                                                    \* ...and is awake to take it home.
                                                    /\ a \notin asleep /\ a \notin turnAsleep

\* WG4: no write lands on a range of the log after a sync that covers it has
\* begun. A sector in flight when the power goes may come back garbled
\* whatever bytes were being written to it, so a late copy of a record, the
\* very bytes already there, must not be in flight over what a sync made
\* durable or is making durable. Tiny example: the owner of order 1 is slow
\* inside its write; order 2's thread writes order 1's record for it, then
\* its own, claims the round and syncs both; the owner's copy lands after
\* the sync began, over bytes it vouched for. Fails under SyncNoWait.
\* Checked by TLC on the rows that set Copies, and on the code by the loom
\* models in src/engine/loom_model/park.rs and
\* src/engine/commit/loom_write_unit.rs (a run, which looks again once
\* counted in) and the tests under the fault shim in
\* src/engine/commit/late_copy_tests.rs; it has no Lean statement.
NoWriteUnderSync ==
  \* Every record of every write in flight, a copy or a run...
  \A b \in Actors : \A j \in fly[b] :
     \* ...is one no completed sync made durable...
     /\ sq[j] > durable
     \* ...and no sync under way vouches for.
     /\ \A a \in round : target[a] = 0 \/ sq[j] > target[a]

\* WU1: one holder of the write unit. Only the holder has a run gathered,
\* and only it has more than one record in flight; every other thread
\* writes one record at a time, as a copy. Rules out: two threads each
\* gathered a run and both write it, which is the contention on the file's
\* lock the unit exists to end, and with a record in both runs, two copies
\* of it in flight that nobody counted on.
OneClaim ==
  \* A gathered run is the holder's.
  /\ \A a \in Actors : gathered[a] # {} => writer = a
  \* So is a write of more than one record.
  /\ \A a \in Actors : Cardinality(fly[a]) > 1 => writer = a

\* The run's ticket bound never stops a live thread, so nothing above is an
\* artefact of the bound.
BoundNeverBinds ==
  \* A live thread that still has to pull a ticket finds one left.
  \A a \in Actors \ stopped : pc[a] \in {"idle", "open", "begun"} => tail < MaxSlots

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* Witnesses. Each of these is FALSE somewhere in the design: a run that

StoppedStaysUnfinished == \A a \in stopped : pc[a] = "ready" => mine[a] > pub

\* "The log is never rotated." Broken once a rotation check seals it.
NeverRotated == gen = 0

\* "No transaction is ever turned away by its own early check." Broken
\* once one is.
NoEarlyAbort == \A a \in Actors : pc[a] # "aborted"

\* "No two threads ever have one record's write in flight." Broken once a
\* thread out of patience has its copy on its way beside the holder's run.
NoTwoCopies == \A a, b \in Actors : a # b => fly[a] \cap fly[b] = {}

\* "No run ever holds two records." Broken once the write unit's holder
\* writes two records with one write.
NoRunOfTwo == \A a \in Actors : Cardinality(fly[a]) <= 1

\* "No thread ever parks on a record." Broken once a writer sleeps until
\* the unit's holder writes its record or lets the unit go.
NeverAsleep == asleep = {}

\* D4: one encoder a record. The FILLING claim lets one thread encode a
\* record into its slot's buffer; two at once would write one buffer
\* together, and the run's holder could send the mixture to the log.
\* Rules out: the owner and a helper both encoding record 1 at once. Fails
\* under EncodeNoClaim.
OneEncoder == \A a, b \in Actors : a # b /\ encoding[a] # 0 => encoding[a] # encoding[b]

\* "Only an owner ever encodes its record." Broken once a thread that needs
\* a record nobody is encoding encodes it itself.
OwnersEncodeOwn == \A a \in Actors : encoding[a] # 0 => encoding[a] = mine[a]

\* "No owner is ever about to write its own record by itself." In a run
\* with no time outs only the fast path does that (or a commit that waits
\* for a sync, copying its record), so this breaks once an owner takes it.
NeverDirect == \A a \in Actors : late[a] = 0 \/ late[a] # mine[a]

\* "No thread ever parks far from its turn." Broken once one does (step 2).
NeverTurnParked == turnAsleep = {}

\* "No run ever ends past its holder's own order." Broken once a holder
\* writes a run that reaches past its own order, which its publishing of
\* the run (WU7) then publishes past its own order too.
NoRunPastOwn == \A a \in Actors : runEnd[a] <= mine[a]

\* "No thread ever runs out of patience." Broken once a parked writer
\* gives up on the holder and writes its record itself.
NeverStolen == \A a \in Actors : late[a] = 0

\* "The write unit is never held by a thread that walked away." Broken once
\* the holder stops for good with the unit claimed, the case the patience
\* exists for.

\* Liveness: what eventually happens.

\* Some live thread has a commit in flight.
LivePending == \E a \in Actors \ stopped : pc[a] \in {"begun", "claimed", "ready"}

\* A step that finishes an order: the published frontier moves.
FrontierMoves == pub' > pub

\* Lock-freedom: either orders keep being finished forever, or there comes
\* a time after which no live thread has work left. A run in which a live
\* thread has work and the frontier stops for good is neither.
LockFree == []<><<FrontierMoves>>_vars \/ <>[](~LivePending)

\* A stopped thread blocks nobody: eventually every thread's call has
\* returned, except the threads that walked away.
EveryLiveCommitCompletes ==
  \* At some point every thread has its answer, or walked away.
  <>(\A a \in Actors : pc[a] \in {"done", "failed", "aborted"} \/ a \in stopped)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* Workloads, chosen by the configurations.

\* Thread 1 writes key 1; thread 2 writes keys 1 and 2; any other thread
\* writes key 2. So threads 1 and 2 conflict on key 1, and thread 2
\* conflicts on key 2 with whoever else is there.
Overlapping == [a \in Actors |-> CASE a = 1 -> {1} [] a = 2 -> {1, 2} [] OTHER -> {2}]

\* Nobody shares a key: every commit lands.
Apart == [a \in Actors |-> {a}]

\* What thread 2 writes when it is a transaction that only reads: nothing.
\* Everybody else writes key 1.
OnlyOneWrites == [a \in Actors |-> IF a = 2 THEN {} ELSE {1}]

\* Everybody read key 1.
AllReadOne == [a \in Actors |-> {1}]
