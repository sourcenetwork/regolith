---- MODULE SyncRwLock ----
\* ===========================================================================
\* THE STORY
\* ===========================================================================
\* A reader-writer lock lets many tasks read at once, or one task write, but
\* never both. regolith's (src/sync/rwlock.rs, src/sync/raw_rwlock.rs and
\* src/sync/reentrant_rwlock.rs) is for async code: a task that cannot enter
\* joins a queue and is woken later instead of blocking its thread.
\*
\* Like the Mutex of Sync.tla it allows "barging": a request that fits the
\* lock right now enters, even past the queue. Tiny example of why that
\* needs a limit: a writer waits; readers keep arriving so that at every
\* moment some reader is inside. Each time a reader leaves, the writer is
\* nudged, finds another reader still inside, and loses. Without a limit it
\* waits for ever. So the waiting writer counts the races it loses, and the
\* retry that would be its Bound-th loss raises a flag on the lock, in the
\* same indivisible step, that says "a handoff is owed". While the flag is
\* up no newcomer gets in: the readers inside leave, and the pass that
\* serves the queue takes the lock for the writer and grants it.
\*
\* The lock also has an "upgradable read": a read guard that can later
\* become the write guard without letting go in between. Tiny example of
\* what can go wrong there: if ANY reader could upgrade, two readers could
\* both ask; each waits for the other to leave, and neither does. So only
\* one upgradable guard exists at a time, and while it waits to upgrade no
\* new plain reader is let in.
\*
\* A third example, which this model found in the code (defect E33). Task
\* A holds the upgradable read and waits to upgrade. A gives up (its future
\* is dropped). Task B now takes the upgradable read. If the pass that
\* serves the queue still believed A's request was alive, and took the
\* write "for A" the moment the last reader left, it would spend the
\* upgradable read that is now B's: the lock would look free while B holds
\* it, and a writer could enter beside B. So a pass never changes the
\* upgradable read for anybody. It only tells a waiting upgrade "the
\* readers have left", and the upgrader takes the write itself.
\*
\* What this model shows, over every interleaving of two or three tasks, one
\* step of the lock at a time: a writer is alone, every guard a task holds
\* is counted in the lock, nobody loses more than Bound races, a handoff
\* cannot be barged, an upgrade never deadlocks and never waits behind new
\* readers, an owner never queues behind itself, no waiter sleeps beside a
\* lock it could enter, and a thread serving the queue runs one pass plus
\* at most one for each thing another thread does to the queue meanwhile.
\* Each planted bug breaks one of these.
\*
\* The locks covered: RwLock and ReentrantRwLock after D49 (barging with
\* bounded bypass between readers and writers), D50 (the upgradable read)
\* and E33 (who takes the write for an upgrade). The code this matches is
\* src/sync/raw_rwlock.rs as fixed for E33 (commit 7bec2a7 on
\* e33/phase-5-mechanisms). This tree gets that commit by merge: until it
\* does, its raw_rwlock.rs still has the step MC_SyncRwLock_Red_PassTakesWrite
\* plants.
\*
\* PROVED FOR EVERY SIZE in Lean, proofs/lean/Regolith/Sync.lean: the
\* barging lock's laws (mutual_exclusion, bounded_bypass, owed_at_bound,
\* owed_exclusive) for an exclusive lock, which this lock's write side
\* follows. The reader-writer sharing, the upgradable read and the reentrant
\* owner rules are checked here only, for two or three tasks; no Lean
\* theorem covers them.

\* The E33 loom model, its calibration and the two unit tests come with the
\* fix itself (commits 7bec2a7 and 6026420 on e33/phase-5-mechanisms), by
\* the same merge.
\*
\* THE CODE MODELLED.
\*   - The state word (WaitQueue::state) holds, above the queue's six flag
\*     bits, the count of readers and three bits: WRITER, UPGRADABLE and
\*     UPGRADING. Each is a variable below.
\*   - Acquire (Contend::poll over RawRwLock, RwWait). One compare-and-swap
\*     enters when the request fits the word and HANDOFF is down, whoever
\*     waits: barging. A read fits while no writer is in and no upgrade is
\*     under way; a write while nobody is in; an upgradable read while no
\*     writer and no other upgradable read is in (raw_rwlock::admits). When
\*     it fails the caller pushes a node, raises QUEUED and looks at its
\*     node once more before sleeping. RwLock::write_owned is the same wait
\*     as write(), in a future and a guard that keep the lock alive
\*     themselves: a task whose role is "write" stands for both.
\*   - A nudged waiter takes back the NUDGE_OUT marker and tries again. A
\*     failed try counts one bypass in the waiting future (Contend::bypass).
\*     The try that would be its Bound-th counted loss is
\*     Lock::take_or_owe: it either enters or raises HANDOFF.
\*   - Release (RawRwLock::read_unlock, write_unlock, upgradable_unlock):
\*     one read-modify-write on the word. Only if waiters need telling does
\*     it go on to ask for a drain pass (Policy::released, a Step::Wake):
\*     waiters queued with no nudge on its way, or a handoff owed, or the
\*     last reader leaving while an upgrade waits.
\*   - The drain role, DIRTY and WAKE_FRONT are the queue's, as in Sync.tla.
\*   - One pass (RawRwLock::pass). It lets go of a withdrawn upgrade's node,
\*     sorts the arrivals (an upgrade's node goes to a slot of its own, the
\*     others to the list), and, if an upgrade waits and no reader is in,
\*     grants its node. While HANDOFF is up it enters the lock for the front
\*     waiters and grants them, oldest first, stopping after a writer. While
\*     no waiter is owed it nudges the front waiter if it fits (or after any
\*     release, even if it does not fit yet), and with a sharing front the
\*     readers behind it for as long as they could share: more than the
\*     front.
\*   - The upgrade (UpgradeWait). The holder of the upgradable read raises
\*     UPGRADING, which holds new readers back. If no reader is in, one
\*     compare-and-swap makes it the writer (RawRwLock::try_upgrade).
\*     Otherwise it queues a node and sleeps. When a pass has granted the
\*     node, its poll makes it the writer with one flip of the three bits
\*     (RawRwLock::finish_upgrade). A dropped upgrade withdraws its node and
\*     releases the upgradable read with upgradable_unlock, whatever the
\*     node's state was.
\*   - ReentrantRwLock keeps, beside the raw lock, each owner's count of
\*     reads and the writing owner with its count of writes. An owner that
\*     reads or writes reads again at once; an owner that writes writes
\*     again at once; an owner that only reads is refused the write
\*     (ReadHeldByOwner). An owner that writes and reads, and drops its last
\*     write, keeps reading: the write becomes one read (downgrade).
\*
\* WHAT IS TAKEN WHOLE HERE, and where it is checked step by step. The
\* queue's own instructions are Sync.tla's, for the same WaitQueue and the
\* same Contend::poll: the seven instructions of take_or_owe (one step
\* here), the waker slots of a node, and the raising of NUDGE_OUT before a
\* pass's first nudge (kept here). A compare-and-swap loop on the state word
\* is one step where its outcome depends on one read of the word.
\*
\* WHAT THE MODEL LEAVES OUT, and why that loses nothing.
\*   - A task has one role (it reads, writes, or takes upgradable reads) and
\*     one waiter node at a time, and does not start an upgrade while a node
\*     it withdrew is still linked; two nodes of one task act as two tasks.
\*   - The tasks of one owner of a ReentrantRwLock run on one thread (Owner,
\*     src/sync/owner.rs), so one of them is inside an operation or waiting
\*     at a time. Two pending requests of one owner are not modelled.
\*   - Polls with no wake, and memory ordering (loom's, plan 7.1).
\*
\* SHORT SCENARIOS. As in Sync.tla, three tasks that each ask as often as
\* they like are far more states than a row may take. Turns says how often
\* each task asks, Start who holds a guard at the beginning, Follows fixes
\* the order two waiters arrive in. The two-task configurations run free.
\*
\* CONFIGURATIONS. See each MC_SyncRwLock_*.cfg for its story.
\*   MC_SyncRwLock_Green_Plain          a writer waits behind two readers.
\*   MC_SyncRwLock_Green_WriterLive     a writer against a reader that
\*                                      keeps coming back: it is served.
\*   MC_SyncRwLock_Green_ReaderLive     a reader against a writer that
\*                                      keeps coming back: it is served.
\*   MC_SyncRwLock_Green_Upgrade        an upgrade behind a reader, with a
\*                                      writer queued.
\*   MC_SyncRwLock_Green_UpgradeLive    an upgrade against a reader that
\*                                      keeps coming back: it completes.
\*   MC_SyncRwLock_Green_UpgradeDropped E33: an upgrade is dropped while the
\*                                      reader leaves and another task takes
\*                                      the upgradable read.
\*   MC_SyncRwLock_Green_Reentrant      two tasks of one owner nest a write
\*                                      and a read; another owner waits.
\*   MC_SyncRwLock_Green_ReentrantLive  one task of each owner: if no owner
\*                                      holds forever, the waiter is served.
\*   MC_SyncRwLock_Red_UnboundedBarging the waiter never raises HANDOFF:
\*                                      BoundedBypass.
\*   MC_SyncRwLock_Red_AnyReaderUpgrade plain readers may upgrade: two wait
\*                                      for each other, NoUpgradeDeadlock.
\*   MC_SyncRwLock_Red_UpgradeNoHoldBack  new readers enter while an upgrade
\*                                      waits: UpgradeHoldsBack.
\*   MC_SyncRwLock_Red_OwnerUnaware     an owner's second read queues while
\*                                      it holds a read: NoSelfDeadlock.
\*   MC_SyncRwLock_Red_PassTakesWrite   E33 as the code was: the pass reads
\*                                      UPGRADING and takes the write for
\*                                      the node in its slot: GuardsCounted.

\* The fixed inputs a configuration chooses.
CONSTANTS
  \* The tasks that use the lock, named by positive numbers.
  Tasks,
  \* Which lock is modelled: "Plain" (RwLock, src/sync/rwlock.rs) or "Reentrant" (ReentrantRwLock,
  \* src/sync/reentrant_rwlock.rs).
  Kind,
  \* Each task's owner token, as a map from task to a positive number (Owner, src/sync/owner.rs).
  \* Tasks with the same token count as one owner.
  Owner,
  \* The largest number of guards one task holds at once (more than 1 only on the reentrant lock).
  MaxDepth,
  \* After how many lost races a waiter is owed a handoff: MAX_BYPASS in src/sync/contend.rs (16 in
  \* the engine, 2 under loom).
  Bound,
  \* What each task asks for, as a map from task to "read", "write" or "upread" (the upgradable
  \* read): the payload READ, WRITE or UPGRADABLE_READ of its waiter node.
  Role,
  \* The tasks that, once they hold the upgradable read, may ask to upgrade it to the write.
  Upgrades,
  \* The tasks that wait when their request does not fit (read, write, upgradable_read). The others
  \* only try (try_read, try_write, try_upgradable_read): when their one attempt fails they go away.
  Waits,
  \* The tasks whose waiting future (an acquire, or an upgrade) may be dropped before it is served.
  Drops,
  \* How many times each task may ask for the lock, as a map from task to number; 0 means as often
  \* as it likes. A small number makes a run a short scenario, the way a test has a few calls.
  Turns,
  \* The tasks that hold a guard of their role when the run starts, the way a test takes the lock
  \* before it spawns its threads. Their first hold counts as one of their turns.
  Start,
  \* For each task, a task that must have queued (or entered) before this one may ask, or 0 for
  \* none: the way a test waits for a "queued" flag before it starts the next thread.
  Follows,
  \* The tasks whose "is eventually served" promises are checked.

\* The state: everything that changes from one step to the next. Each line says what the variable

VARIABLES
  \* The count of readers in the state word (the bits above READER_SHIFT in src/sync/raw_rwlock.rs).
  \* The reentrant lock counts reading owners here, not read guards.
  readers,
  \* The WRITER bit: a writer is in.
  writer,
  \* The UPGRADABLE bit: the upgradable read is out.
  upgradable,
  \* The UPGRADING bit: the holder of the upgradable read has asked to upgrade, so new readers are
  \* held back.
  upgrading,
  \* The DRAINING bit of the state word (src/sync/queue.rs): some thread holds the drain role, the
  \* only one allowed to sort arrivals, grant and nudge.
  drainOn,
  \* The DIRTY bit: something changed while the drain role was held, so its holder must pass again
  \* before it lets go.
  dirty,
  \* The QUEUED bit: waiters may be queued, so a release has somebody to tell.
  queued,
  \* The NUDGE_OUT bit: a nudge is on its way to a waiter that has not polled yet, so a release need
  \* not run another pass.
  nudgeOut,
  \* The HANDOFF bit: a waiter is owed a handoff. While it is up nobody may barge.
  handoff,
  \* The WAKE_FRONT bit: a release (or a nudged waiter that withdrew) asks the next pass to nudge
  \* the front waiter whatever it asks for.
  wakeFront,
  \* How many queued waiters count themselves owed a handoff (WaitQueue::owed).
  owedCount,
  \* The arrival stack: nodes pushed by waiters and not yet taken by a pass, oldest first.
  arrivals,
  \* The waiting list a pass keeps between passes, oldest first (Waiting::list in
  \* src/sync/raw_rwlock.rs). Only the holder of the drain role touches it. A withdrawn node stays
  \* linked until a pass lets go of it.
  waiting,
  \* The slot a pass keeps the waiting upgrade's node in (Waiting::upgrade): a task, or 0 for none.
  upSlot,
  \* The phase of each task's waiter node: "none" (no node), "waiting", "granted" (a pass granted
  \* it) or "cancelled" (its future withdrew).
  phase,
  \* Each node's NUDGED bit: a pass asked the waiter to try again and it has not looked yet.
  nudged,
  \* Each node's OWED bit: the waiter reached the bypass bound and is counted in owedCount.
  owedMark,
  \* What each node asks for (its payload): "read", "write", "upread", or "upgrade" (the upgradable
  \* read's wait to become the write).
  nkind,
  \* Whether each task's waker was called since the task last polled: the executor will poll it.
  wake,
  \* The wake list of the pass under way: the sleeping tasks it granted or nudged, whose wakers it
  \* calls when it gives the drain role up (WakeList, src/sync/waiter.rs).
  wl,
  \* How many times each task's pending acquire has entered the lock word (by its own
  \* compare-and-swap, or by a pass on its behalf) without being a guard yet.
  got,
  \* How many guards each task holds.
  held,
  \* The kind of guard each task holds: "none", "read", "write" or "upread".

  wowner,
  \* ReentrantRwLock only: how many write guards the writing owner holds (write_depth).
  wdepth,
  \* Each waiting future's count of lost races (Contend::bypass, src/sync/contend.rs).
  bypass,
  \* A local of Contend::cancel: whether the withdrawn node carried a nudge nobody used.
  passOn,
  \* A local of UpgradeWait::cancel: whether the dropped upgrade's node withdrew (it had not been
  \* granted), so the queue must be told.
  upW,
  \* A local of the pass under way: whether WAKE_FRONT was up when the pass began (`wake_front`).
  dWF,
  \* A local of the pass under way: the reader count of the lock as its nudging pictures it
  \* (`sharing`: the word it read, with the waiters it has nudged so far entered).
  dSR,
  \* A local of the pass under way: the WRITER bit of that picture.
  dSW,
  \* A local of the pass under way: the UPGRADABLE bit of that picture.
  dSU,
  \* A local of the pass under way: the UPGRADING bit of that picture.
  dSG,
  \* A local of the pass under way: the place in the waiting list its nudging has reached.
  dPos,
  \* A local of the pass under way: TRUE until its nudging has passed the first live waiter.
  dFirst,
  \* A local of the pass under way: whether it raised NUDGE_OUT (Nudges::raised).

\* The pass nudges the waiter at place i: the front waiter if it fits or a release asked for it to
\* be nudged anyway; a later waiter only if it fits, is no writer, and the front was no writer.

  \* The front waiter:

  \* a later one.

\* Where the pass goes when its walk is over: to lower NUDGE_OUT if it raised it for nothing, else

\* The nudge itself (WakeList::nudge: one compare-and-swap on the node), and what follows it. A
\* node that still waits and carries no nudge gets the NUDGED mark, and a sleeping future goes on
\* the wake list. A node that is nudged already is left alone, but a nudge is on its way to it all
\* the same, so the marker must stay up. Then the walk goes on with this waiter entered in the

\* Invariants.

\* Every variable holds what its comment says.

  /\ Range(arrivals) \subseteq Tasks /\ Range(waiting) \subseteq Tasks /\ upSlot \in Tasks \cup {0}
  \* Every node is in one of the four phases and asks for one of the four things.
  /\ phase \in [Tasks -> {"none", "waiting", "granted", "cancelled"}]
  \* (what it asks for)
  /\ nkind \in [Tasks -> {"read", "write", "upread", "upgrade"}]
  \* Nobody has more than two entries pending, or holds more guards than allowed.
  /\ got \in [Tasks -> 0..2] /\ held \in [Tasks -> 0..MaxDepth]
  \* Every guard is of one of the kinds.
  /\ mode \in [Tasks -> {"none", "read", "write", "upread"}]
  \* The writing owner is an owner token or none.
  /\ wowner \in Owners \cup {NoOwner}
  \* A pass's hand holds one kind of entry or nothing.
  /\ dHand \in {"none", "read", "write", "upread"}
  \* Every task is at one of the known places.
  /\ pc \in [Tasks -> PCs]

\* Only the holder of the drain role is inside the drain, and there is at most one.
\* Rules out two threads sorting the same waiting list at once, which would corrupt it: the list
\* has no lock of its own.
DrainExclusive ==
  \* The DRAINING bit is up exactly while some task is at a drain step.
  /\ drainOn <=> \E t \in Tasks : pc[t] \in DrainPCs
  \* No two tasks are at a drain step.
  /\ \A t, u \in Tasks : pc[t] \in DrainPCs /\ pc[u] \in DrainPCs => t = u

\* Every node is in exactly one place: a node that waits, or that withdrew and is not let go yet,
\* is on the arrival stack, in the waiting list or in the upgrade slot, once.
\* Rules out a waiter that is linked nowhere, which no pass could ever grant or let go: under the
\* bug of E33 a second upgrade's node took the slot from a withdrawn one that was still in it.
NodesLinked ==
  \* No node is linked twice.
  /\ Len(arrivals \o waiting) = Cardinality(Range(arrivals \o waiting))
  \* The slot's node is not in the list, and asks for the upgrade.
  /\ upSlot # 0 => upSlot \notin Range(waiting) /\ nkind[upSlot] = "upgrade"
  \* A node that waits or withdrew is linked.
  /\ \A t \in Tasks : phase[t] \in {"waiting", "cancelled"} =>

       t \in Range(arrivals \o waiting) \/ t = upSlot

\* The tasks that hold a guard of kind k.
Holders(k) == {t \in Tasks : held[t] > 0 /\ mode[t] = k}

\* Task t is inside an upgrade it has begun and not ended: between raising UPGRADING and taking
\* the write or letting the upgradable read go. That includes the drain it may run itself when it
\* publishes its node.
InUpgrade(t) ==
  \* At one of the upgrade's own places,
  \/ pc[t] \in {"uptry", "uppush", "upenq", "uppark0", "upparked", "upfin", "upunl"}
  \* or draining on the way to its first look at its node.
  \/ pc[t] \in DrainPCs /\ ret[t] = "uppark0"

\* THE LOCK WORD COUNTS EXACTLY WHAT IS OUT. The reader count, the WRITER bit and the UPGRADABLE bit
\* say exactly what guards exist, what entries are pending for a future, and what a pass holds in
\* its hand; and UPGRADING is up exactly while an upgrade is under way.
\* Rules out, for example: a reader's share that is never given back (no writer ever enters
\* again), or a share given back twice (a writer enters beside a reader).
WordMatchesGuards ==
  \* The readers: the read guards (on the reentrant lock: the owners that read and do not write),
  /\ readers = (IF Kind = "Plain" THEN Cardinality(Holders("read"))
                \* (the reading owners with no write of their own)
                ELSE Cardinality({o \in Owners : rdepth[o] > 0 /\ wowner # o}))
               \* the entries pending for readers, and a read in a pass's hand.
               + SumOf(got, {t \in Tasks : Role[t] = "read"}) + (IF dHand = "read" THEN 1 ELSE 0)
  \* The writer: a write guard, an entry pending for a writer, or a write in a pass's hand.
  /\ writer <=> \/ (IF Kind = "Plain" THEN Holders("write") # {} ELSE wowner # NoOwner)
                \* (pending, or in hand)
                \/ (\E t \in Tasks : Role[t] = "write" /\ got[t] > 0) \/ dHand = "write"
  \* The upgradable read: its guard, an entry pending for it, or one in a pass's hand.
  /\ upgradable <=> \/ Holders("upread") # {}
                    \* (pending, or in hand)
                    \/ (\E t \in Tasks : Role[t] = "upread" /\ got[t] > 0) \/ dHand = "upread"
  \* An upgrade is under way exactly while the holder of the upgradable read is inside one.
  /\ upgrading <=> \E t \in Holders("upread") : InUpgrade(t)

\* EVERY GUARD HELD IS COUNTED IN THE LOCK. A task that holds a guard and is at rest has it in the
\* lock word: a reader is counted, a writer has WRITER up, the upgradable read has UPGRADABLE up.
\* Rules out, for example (E33): task A's dropped upgrade, or the pass that still held A's node,
\* lowers the UPGRADABLE bit that task B raised; B holds the upgradable read, the lock looks free,
\* and a writer enters beside B.
GuardsCounted ==
  \* For every task at rest with a guard:
  \A t \in Tasks : pc[t] = "holding" /\ held[t] > 0 =>
    \* a plain read is counted,
    /\ (Kind = "Plain" /\ mode[t] = "read") => readers > 0
    \* a plain write has WRITER up,
    /\ (Kind = "Plain" /\ mode[t] = "write") => writer
    \* and the upgradable read has UPGRADABLE up.
    /\ mode[t] = "upread" => upgradable

\* MUTUAL EXCLUSION. While a task holds a write guard, no task of another owner holds any guard;
\* and at most one task holds the upgradable read. Lean (exclusive side): mutual_exclusion.
\* Rules out a writer changing the value while a reader of another owner is looking at it.
MutualExclusion ==
  \* A write guard excludes every guard of another owner.
  /\ \A t, u \in Tasks : (held[t] > 0 /\ mode[t] = "write" /\ held[u] > 0) => Owner[t] = Owner[u]
  \* At most one upgradable guard is out.
  /\ Cardinality(Holders("upread")) <= 1

\* REENTRANCY DEPTH. The reentrant lock's counts are exactly the guards out: each owner's reads,
\* the write guards, and a writing owner exactly while a write guard is out.
\* Rules out, for example: an owner drops one of two write guards and the lock is free while it
\* still holds the other.
ReentrancyDepth ==
  \* Only the reentrant lock keeps these counts.
  Kind = "Reentrant" =>
    \* The write guards out are the write guards the tasks hold,
    /\ wdepth = SumOf(held, {t \in Tasks : Role[t] = "write"})
    \* held by the writing owner's tasks only,
    /\ \A t \in Tasks : (Role[t] = "write" /\ held[t] > 0) => Owner[t] = wowner
    \* each owner's reads are the read guards its tasks hold,
    /\ \A o \in Owners : rdepth[o] = SumOf(held, {t \in Tasks : Role[t] = "read" /\ Owner[t] = o})
    \* and there is a writing owner exactly while a write guard is out.
    /\ (wowner = NoOwner <=> wdepth = 0)

\* BOUNDED BYPASS. A waiter, reader or writer, loses the race at most Bound times, and at Bound
\* the HANDOFF bit is up, so nobody barges past it again. Lean: bounded_bypass, at_bound_owed.
\* Rules out, for example: a writer waits while readers keep arriving so that some reader is always
\* inside; every time the writer is nudged it finds a reader and loses, for ever.
BoundedBypass ==
  \* For every task:
  \A t \in Tasks :
    \* it lost at most Bound counted races, and its own count says no more;
    /\ lost[t] <= Bound /\ bypass[t] <= Bound
    \* and once it has lost Bound of them and still waits, barging is shut.
    /\ AtBound(t) => handoff

\* HANDOFF EXCLUSIVE. Nobody enters through the fast path while a handoff is owed.
\* Lean: owed_blocks_barging.
\* Rules out a newcomer slipping in while the lock is kept for a waiter that lost Bound times.
HandoffExclusive == ~bargedOwed

\* UPGRADE HOLDS READERS BACK. No plain reader enters while an upgrade waits.
\* Rules out, for example: an upgrade waits for the readers to leave, and new readers keep entering,
\* so it waits for ever.
UpgradeHoldsBack == ~readInUpgrade

\* NO UPGRADE DEADLOCK. Every reader an upgrade waits for is free to drop its guard: it is never
\* itself asleep on the lock.
\* Rules out, for example: two readers both ask to upgrade; each waits for the other to leave, and
\* neither does.
NoUpgradeDeadlock ==
  \* For every task whose upgrade waits,
  \A t \in Tasks : pc[t] \in {"upparked", "rupwait"} =>
    \* every other task that holds a read guard is not asleep waiting for the lock.
    \A u \in Tasks \ {t} : (held[u] > 0 /\ mode[u] = "read") =>
      pc[u] \notin {"parked", "upparked", "rupwait"}

\* NO SELF-DEADLOCK. No task waits in the queue for a lock its own owner holds a guard of.
\* Rules out, for example: an owner that holds a read guard asks for another read, is queued behind
\* a waiting writer, and so waits on a lock that its own guard keeps the writer out of.
NoSelfDeadlock ==
  \* For every task whose acquire waits,
  \A t \in Tasks : (phase[t] = "waiting" /\ nkind[t] # "upgrade") =>
    \* no task of its owner holds a guard.
    \A u \in Tasks : Owner[u] = Owner[t] => held[u] = 0

\* A sleeping future whose node carries a mark (granted, or nudged) has had its waker called, or
\* is on the wake list of the pass under way. Lean: handed_woken.
MarkedWoken ==
  \* For every task that sleeps with its node granted or nudged:
  \A t \in Tasks : (pc[t] \in {"parked", "upparked"} /\ (phase[t] = "granted" \/ nudged[t])) =>
    \* its waker was called, or the pass under way is about to call it.
    wake[t] \/ t \in wl

\* Every task is between operations and nobody holds the drain role.
Quiescent == ~drainOn /\ \A t \in Tasks : pc[t] \in Rest

\* The live waiters of the list, oldest first.
LiveQ == SelectSeq(waiting, LAMBDA u : phase[u] = "waiting")

\* Left behind with nobody to act, once everything is quiet.
Stranded ==
  \* An arrival no pass took in;
  \/ arrivals # <<>>
  \* or a waiter, in the list or in the slot, with the QUEUED bit down, so that no release would
  \* look for it;
  \/ (LiveQ # <<>> \/ (upSlot # 0 /\ phase[upSlot] = "waiting")) /\ ~queued
  \* or a front waiter whose request fits, and either a handoff is owed (the pass should have
  \* granted it) or its waker was not called (nobody told it to try);
  \/ LiveQ # <<>> /\ Admits(nkind[Head(LiveQ)]) /\ (handoff \/ ~wake[Head(LiveQ)])
  \* or an upgrade asleep although no reader is inside;
  \/ upSlot # 0 /\ phase[upSlot] = "waiting" /\ upgrading /\ readers = 0
  \* or the NUDGE_OUT marker up with no woken waiter left to take it back, so that every later
  \* release would skip its pass;
  \/ nudgeOut /\ ~\E t \in Tasks : pc[t] = "parked" /\ wake[t]
  \* or a release's request to nudge the front still up, with no pass left to act on it.
  \/ wakeFront

\* NO LOST WAKEUP. A mark on a sleeping future comes with a wake; and once every task is between
\* operations, no waiter sleeps while it could proceed. Lean: no_stranded_head, handed_woken.
\* Rules out, for example: the last reader leaves and tells nobody; the writer, or the upgrade,
\* sleeps for ever beside a lock it could have.
NoLostWakeup == MarkedWoken /\ (Quiescent => ~Stranded)

\* CANCELLATION PASSES ON. An idle task holds nothing: a waiter dropped after a grant gave it
\* back, and a dropped upgrade gave the upgradable read back.
\* Rules out, for example: a writer is granted the lock, its future is dropped before it runs, and
\* the lock stays held by nobody.
CancelPassesOn == \A t \in Tasks : pc[t] = "idle" => held[t] = 0 /\ got[t] = 0

\* A DRAIN'S PASSES ARE EARNED, as in Sync.tla. A drain runs one pass. It runs another only if,
\* since that pass began, an operation of another thread landed on it that has something to tell
\* the queue: a waiter that queues, withdraws, or claims the handoff it is owed; or a release that
\* finds a node queued. A release over an empty queue costs it none. The locks are lock-free, not
\* wait-free: there is no fixed number of passes.
\* Rules out a thread kept serving the queue by releases that have nobody to tell.
DrainBounded == ~overran

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* Liveness. Checked for the tasks in Watched.

\* Every waiter stops waiting: it is granted the lock, enters itself, or cancels.
\* Rules out a writer that waits for ever although the readers keep leaving, and a reader that
\* waits for ever behind writers.
EveryWaiterServed ==
  \* For every watched task, whenever its acquire waits, later it does not.
  \A t \in Watched : (phase[t] = "waiting" /\ nkind[t] # "upgrade") ~> (phase[t] # "waiting")

\* Every upgrade completes: the upgrader comes to hold the write, or its upgrade is dropped.
\* Rules out an upgrade that waits for ever behind readers that keep arriving.
UpgradeCompletes ==
  \* For every watched task, whenever it has begun an upgrade, later it holds or is idle.
  \A t \in Watched : (pc[t] = "uptry") ~> (pc[t] \in {"holding", "idle"})

\* A waiter operation lands on a drain: task t queues, withdraws, or claims its handoff, and
\* finds the drain role taken, so the holder of the role passes once more for it.
Lands(t) ==
  \* The role is taken,
  /\ drainOn
  \* and the task publishes a node, or tells the queue it withdrew,
  /\ \/ Publish(t) \/ UpPublish(t) \/ Wd2(t) \/ UpWithdrawn(t)
     \* or raises HANDOFF.
     \/ (Owe(t) /\ ~handoff /\ handoff')

\* From some point on, no waiter operation lands on a drain.
WaitersSettle == <>[][\A t \in Tasks : ~Lands(t)]_vars

\* Again and again, each task is outside the drain.
DrainsEnd == \A t \in Tasks : []<>(pc[t] \notin DrainPCs)

\* EVERY DRAIN ENDS, ONCE THE WAITERS SETTLE, as in Sync.tla. The condition is needed: each waiter
\* that queues or withdraws while a drain runs costs its holder one more pass (DrainBounded).
\* Rules out a pass that never finishes its walk, or a drain that goes on passing when nothing asks
\* it to.
DrainsEndWhenWaitersSettle == WaitersSettle => DrainsEnd

\* Owner o holds the lock in some way.
OwnerHolds(o) == \E t \in Tasks : Owner[t] = o /\ held[t] > 0

\* No owner keeps the lock forever.
OwnersLetGo == \A o \in Owners : []<>(~OwnerHolds(o))

\* If no owner holds the lock forever, every waiter is served.
ServedIfOwnersLetGo == OwnersLetGo => EveryWaiterServed
