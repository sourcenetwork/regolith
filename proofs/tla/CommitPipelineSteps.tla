---- MODULE CommitPipelineSteps ----
\* The lock-free commit pipeline: its steps, one action each, in the order
\* a commit meets them. The state they act on is in
\* CommitPipelineBase.tla, and what must be true of them, with the whole
\* story of the model, in CommitPipeline.tla.

\* The state and the helpers.
EXTENDS CommitPipelineBase

\* Actions. Each is one small step of one thread: an add, a
\* compare-and-swap, a write that is safe to repeat, or a store.

\* The start: an empty ring and an empty database.

\* Order i's record may be written by thread a in one go, without the write

\* With copies, the first of a write's two steps, for the round's holder:

\* THE WRITE UNIT (write_unit.rs). With Copies, the records reach the log
\* the way the code sends them: each owner encodes its own record, or a
\* thread that needs one nobody is encoding encodes it (EncodeStart,
\* EncodeEnd);
\* one thread at a time holds the write unit, gathers the run of filled
\* records that waits first (Gather), counts in at the gate and looks at
\* them again (RunStart), writes them with one write (WriteLand), and lets
\* the unit go (Release). A thread whose record is in another's hands parks
\* on it (Park) until somebody wakes it, or until its patience runs out
\* (Timeout): then it writes the record itself, as a copy (StealStart).
\*
\* Tiny example: threads 1 and 2 each have a settled order. Thread 1 fills
\* its record and claims the unit; thread 2 fills its record too and finds
\* the unit held, so it parks on its record, asking to be woken when the
\* unit is let go. Thread 1's run held only record 1 (record 2 was not
\* filled when it looked), so when thread 1 lets the unit go it wakes thread
\* 2, which claims the unit and writes record 2. Had thread 1 stopped while
\* holding the unit, thread 2 would have run out of patience and written
\* record 2 itself.

\* Thread a claims the encoding of order i's record: its own, once i is
\* settled, or the record it needs next when nobody is encoding it
\* (write_unit.rs, RegolithEngine::fill; descriptor.rs, Descriptor::fill,
\* the FILLING claim, one read-modify-write). Mutant EncodeNoClaim skips the
