---- MODULE StallRelief ----
\* ===========================================================================
\* THE STORY
\* ===========================================================================
\* A write stall "stop" refuses every write until the background makes room
\* (too many memtables, or too many tables in level 0). On a database with
\* no compaction worker and inline compaction on (Options::inline_compaction)
\* nobody does that in the background: a stopped writer relieves the stop
\* itself, with flush and compaction steps on its own thread
\* (RegolithEngine::relieve_inline, src/engine/mod.rs). A step needs the
\* "gate" (the flush exclusion, or the compaction gate). When another thread
\* holds it the step is "contended", and the writer, instead of waiting for
\* the gate, returns at once with a wait (WouldBlock::Stall) on one shared
\* unit (StallSignal, src/engine/commit/stall.rs), trusting the thread that
\* holds the gate.
\*
\* Three kinds of thread hold the gate:
\*   - a stopped writer relieving the stop, step after step;
\*   - a writer whose write went in and left one step owing, which it runs
\*     once after its commit (run_owed, src/engine/background_step.rs) and
\*     then returns: it relieves nothing more;
\*   - a foreground job (compact_range, an ingest, a checkpoint;
\*     src/engine/foreground.rs), which holds the gate for its whole run.
\*
\* Tiny example 1, the owed step. Writer 1's write goes in and brings on the
\* stop. Its owed step takes the gate. Writer 2 is stopped, its step finds
\* the gate held, and it waits on the unit. Writer 1's step leaves the stop
\* on (one flush, and still too many tables), and writer 1 returns: that
\* was its last write. If the unit landed only when the stop cleared, nobody
\* would land it, and writer 2 would wait for ever. This is the hang seen in
\* the test `the_published_high_water_mark_holds_under_many_concurrent_writers`:
\* twelve writers parked on the stall, nobody running a step.
\*
\* The fix, "relief handed back": where writers relieve the stop, every
\* piece of progress (each step, once its gate is released) counts itself
\* and lands the unit, stop or no stop (StallSignal::refresh). Each waiter
\* looks again, and relieves the stop itself, or is contended anew.
\*
\* Tiny example 2, the gap. Writer 2 found the gate held, but registers its
\* wait only a moment later. In that moment writer 1's step ends and lands
\* the unit, with nobody on it yet. Writer 2 registers after the landing and
\* waits for ever. So the writer reads the progress count before its step,
\* reads it again once registered, and, if it moved, lands its own unit
\* (StallSignal::wait, `seen`).
\*
\* Tiny example 3, the job. A job holds the gate; writers find it held and
\* wait; the job ends. A job compacts nothing on its own, so it must relieve
\* the stop once it releases the gate, and land the unit
\* (RegolithEngine::relieve_after_foreground).
\*
\* Tiny example 4, the latch (E35). The engine "latches" when its log is
\* left in a state nobody can vouch for (a sync that failed while a rotation
\* sealed the log, a rollback that failed): from then on every write fails
\* with that reason (RegolithEngine::latch, src/engine/mod.rs). A latched
\* engine relieves no stop: a write fails before it runs any step. Writer 2
\* waits on the unit; the engine latches; nothing is promised to clear the
\* stop any more, so writer 2 would wait until the database closes. So the
\* latch lands the unit, and writer 2, writing again, is told the latch, as
\* a fresh write is (admit_write).
\*
\* The same gap as example 2 opens here. Writer 2 was let in before the
\* latch, and registers its wait after the latch landed the unit: it would
\* wait on a unit nobody lands. So the latch stores its flag BEFORE it takes
\* the unit, and a writer reads the flag again once registered
\* (RegolithEngine::stall_wait): either the latch found the writer on the
\* unit, or the writer reads the flag.
\*
\* Tiny example 5, the rotation that fails. Writer 1's write was let in with
\* no stop, and finds the active memtable full and the memtable cap reached:
\* it flushes the oldest frozen memtable itself, holding the gate, before it
\* seals the active one (the rotation of a write's turn,
\* RegolithEngine::rotate, src/engine/commit/turn.rs). Meanwhile the stop comes on;
\* writer 2 finds the gate held and waits. Writer 1's flush ends, with the
\* stop still on. Then its seal fails (the next log cannot be created, or
\* the old one cannot be synced), and writer 1 returns the error. The flush
\* changed what the stop counts, so the rotation counts its progress on
\* every way out, failed or not; if it counted only once the seal went
\* through, writer 2 would be left waiting. (The step the flush left owing
\* does not save it: it waits on writer 1's queue until that is polled, and
\* on a latched engine it fails before it counts anything.)
\*
\* Tiny example 6, the relief that fails (E36). The work that relieves a
\* stop is a flush or a compaction, and it can fail: the disk is full, a
\* file is missing. Its failure is recorded
\* (BackgroundHealth::record_failure, src/engine/background_health.rs) and
\* stays recorded until that work next succeeds. A write that is stopped
\* while it is recorded is not handed a wait: it is told the failure
\* (RegolithEngine::stopped), because the stop will not clear while its
\* relief fails. Writer 2 was stopped a moment earlier, when the relief was
\* still working, and waits on the unit; then the relief fails. Writer 2
\* would wait on, while every write that arrives after it is told why. So
\* recording a failure lands the unit, and writer 2, writing again, is told
\* what a fresh write is told. When the relief succeeds again the record is
\* cleared, and a stopped write waits as before.
\*
\* The gap of example 2 opens a third time, and is closed the same way: the
\* failure is stored BEFORE the unit is taken, and a writer reads it again
\* once registered, as a fresh write would: only while a stop still holds
\* (RegolithEngine::stall_wait).
\*
\* Tiny example 7, the commit. A plain write that is stopped can be handed
\* the wait: its caller still has the data and writes again. A transaction's
\* commit cannot be made a second time, so the commit that meets a stop is
\* not ended with the wait: it stays, waits on the unit like any stopped
\* writer, and writes once the unit lands (RegolithEngine::admit_commit,
\* admit_commit_nowait, src/engine/mod.rs). Commit 1 finds the stop on and
\* the gate held by writer 2's step. Handed the wait, it would be over,
\* with nothing of it written and nothing said that the stop will not
\* clear: the transaction would be lost to the stall. It also does not give
\* up while its own steps make progress, as a plain writer at its bound
\* does.
\*
\* What this model checks cannot happen: every writer has finished or
\* waits on the stall, the job is not running or still to relieve, no latch
\* and no recorded failure is on its way to land the unit, and a writer
\* waits: nobody is left to land its unit (NoStrandedWait). And: the engine
\* latched, its landing is done, and a writer waits (NoWaitOnceLatched).
\* And: the relief's failure is recorded, its landing is done, and a writer
\* waits (NoWaitOnceFailing). And: a commit that met a stop is over with
\* its write not in and without having been told the latch or the relief's
\* failure (NoLostCommit).
\*
\* WHAT IS MODELLED, and the code each piece mirrors:
\*   stopped   whether writes are stopped now (StallSignal::classify)
\*   gate      who holds the gate: nobody, the job, or a writer
\*   job       the job's progress: not started, holding the gate, about to
\*             relieve after releasing it, finished
\*   wpc       each writer's progress (see TypeOK)
\*   progress  the progress count (StallSignal::progress)
\*   seen      the count each contended writer read before its step
\*   latched   whether the engine latched (RegolithEngine::is_latched)
\*   landing   whether a latch stored its flag and has yet to land the unit
\*   failing   whether the relief's last attempt failed and none has
\*             succeeded since (BackgroundHealth::failing)
\*   telling   whether a failure was recorded and has yet to land the unit
\*   fate      how each commit's call ended: its write went in, it was
\*             told a failure, it gave up, or it was handed the wait
\*
\* WHAT IS LEFT OUT, and why that loses nothing:
\*   - The kind of stop and of step (flush or compaction): any step may
\*     clear the stop or leave it on, and a write that goes in may bring it
\*     on, so every mix is covered.
\*   - The job's relief steps hold the gate too; here they are one step with
\*     the gate free. A writer contended on them waits for their progress
\*     the same way it waits for a writer's.
\*   - A stopped writer with a queue: its relieving step is a job on one
\*     writer's queue, and a queue dropped before running it lands the unit
\*     (StallStep::release), the same hand-back.
\*   - Several jobs: they take the gate one at a time, each ends with the
\*     same relief.
\*   - The bound on a writer's steps: here a writer may give up after any
\*     step with the stop on, which covers every bound.
\*   - A database with a compaction worker. There a stopped writer runs no
\*     step: it waits for the worker's. The latch rule is the same, and is
\*     the case of this model where no writer ever holds the gate: after the
\*     latch nothing is promised to clear the stop, so the latch lands the
\*     unit.
\*   - A database with no worker and inline compaction turned off. There a
\*     stopped plain writer runs no step either, and its caller is told to
\*     compact; a commit still relieves the stop itself, since nobody else
\*     is certain to. That a commit does is not shown by this model, where
\*     every stopped writer relieves: it is checked by the tests
\*     (tests/no_worker_stall_relief.rs).
\*   - Why the engine latched, and which thread did it: any thread, at any
\*     moment, once.
\*   - Which work failed and on which thread: the worker's flush or
\*     compaction, or a writer's own flush. Here the relief of the stop fails
\*     at any moment and recovers at any later one, as often as it likes. A
\*     failure of the other kind of work only lands the unit: the writers
\*     look again and wait again, which the model's landings already cover.
\*
\* CONFIGURATIONS (each GREEN must pass, each RED must break the one
\* invariant it names):
\*   MC_StallRelief_Green           two writers, one job, the real code:
\*                                  NoStrandedWait holds.
\*   MC_StallRelief_Red_NoRelief    the job releases the gate and ends with
\*                                  no relief: NoStrandedWait breaks.
\*   MC_StallRelief_Red_NoHandBack  progress lands the unit only when the
\*                                  stop cleared (example 1):
\*                                  NoStrandedWait breaks.
\*   MC_StallRelief_Red_NoRecheck   a contended writer registers without
\*                                  reading the count again (example 2):
\*                                  NoStrandedWait breaks.
\*   MC_StallRelief_Green_Failures  the real code, with what can fail: the
\*                                  engine latching, and a rotation at the
\*                                  memtable cap whose seal may fail. Both
\*                                  rules hold.
\*   MC_StallRelief_Red_NoLatchLand the latch stores its flag and lands
\*                                  nothing (example 4): NoWaitOnceLatched
\*                                  breaks.
\*   MC_StallRelief_Red_NoLatchRecheck
\*                                  a writer registers without reading the
\*                                  latch's flag again (example 4, the
\*                                  gap): NoWaitOnceLatched breaks.
\*   MC_StallRelief_Red_NoRotateRefresh
\*                                  a rotation whose seal fails counts no
\*                                  progress (example 5): NoStrandedWait
\*                                  breaks.
\*   MC_StallRelief_Green_ReliefFails
\*                                  the real code, with a relief that fails
\*                                  and recovers (example 6). All three
\*                                  rules hold.
\*   MC_StallRelief_Red_NoFailLand  a failure is recorded and lands nothing:
\*                                  NoWaitOnceFailing breaks.
\*   MC_StallRelief_Red_NoFailRecheck
\*                                  a writer registers without reading the
\*                                  recorded failure again (example 6, the
\*                                  gap): NoWaitOnceFailing breaks.
\*
\*   MC_StallRelief_Green_Commit    the real code, one commit and one
\*                                  plain writer, with a relief that may
\*                                  fail: however the commit's call ends,
\*                                  NoLostCommit holds, with the other
\*                                  three.
\*   MC_StallRelief_Green_Commit_Failures
\*                                  the same pair with an engine that may
\*                                  latch and a rotation whose seal may
\*                                  fail: NoLostCommit holds.
\*   MC_StallRelief_Red_CommitTakesWait
\*                                  a commit the stall would leave waiting
\*                                  is handed the wait and its call is over
\*                                  (example 7): NoLostCommit breaks.
\*   MC_StallRelief_Red_CommitGivesUp
\*                                  a commit gives up at a plain writer's
\*                                  bound, with the stop on and its own
\*                                  steps making progress: NoLostCommit
\*                                  breaks.
\*
\* Lean, proofs/lean/Regolith/StallRelief.lean, proves the three rules about
\* waiting for any number of writers, and each of their REDs as a run of
\* the buggy steps. NoLostCommit is checked by TLC here and by the tests
\* (tests/commit_through_stall.rs, src/engine/commit/stall_commit_tests.rs);
\* its Lean statement is still owed.

\* Numbers, for the progress count.

\* THE RULE. Once every writer has finished or waits on the stall, the job
\* is not running or still to relieve, and neither a latch nor a recorded
\* failure has its landing owed, no writer waits: someone was always on the
\* way to land its unit. Rules out the stories: writer 2 left waiting after
\* writer 1's last owed step, after a landing it registered too late for,
\* after the job, and after a rotation whose seal failed. Lean:
\* no_stranded_wait.
NoStrandedWait ==
  \* With nobody left but waiters ...
  (/\ job \notin {"holding", "relieving"}
   /\ ~landing
   /\ ~telling
   /\ \A w \in Writers : wpc[w] \in {"waiting", "done"})
    \* ... no writer waits.
    => \A w \in Writers : wpc[w] # "waiting"

\* THE LATCH'S RULE (E35). Once the engine latched and its landing is done,
\* no writer waits: a latched engine clears no stop, so a writer still
\* waiting then would wait until the database closes. Rules out example 4,
\* and its gap: a writer that registers after the latch landed the unit.
\* Lean: no_wait_once_latched.
NoWaitOnceLatched ==
  \* Latched, and the landing done ...
  (latched /\ ~landing)
    \* ... no writer waits.
    => \A w \in Writers : wpc[w] # "waiting"

\* THE FAILING RELIEF'S RULE (E36). While the relief's failure is recorded
\* and its landing is done, no writer waits: a write that arrives then is
\* told the failure, so one that was already waiting is told it too. Rules
\* out example 6, and its gap: a writer that registers after the failure
\* landed the unit. Once the relief recovers the rule asks nothing, and
\* writers wait for the stop again. Lean: no_wait_once_failing.
NoWaitOnceFailing ==
  \* The failure recorded, and the landing done ...
  (failing /\ ~telling)
    \* ... no writer waits.
    => \A w \in Writers : wpc[w] # "waiting"

\* THE COMMIT'S RULE. No commit is lost to a stall: however a commit's call
\* ends, its write went in, or it was told a failure that says the write
\* cannot be made (the engine latched, the relief of the stop is failing, a
\* rotation's seal failed). It is never handed the wait, as a plain write
\* is (example 7), and it never gives up while its own steps make progress.
\* The record is kept in every mode, so the rule is read off what happened,
\* in every interleaving with the job, the latch, a failing relief and
\* rotations. NoStrandedWait is the other half of "a commit waits the stop
\* out": a commit left waiting always has someone on the way to land its
\* unit. Checked by TLC and by the tests (tests/commit_through_stall.rs,
\* src/engine/commit/stall_commit_tests.rs); the Lean statement is still
\* owed.
NoLostCommit ==
  \* Every commit's call has not ended, or ended with its write in, or with a failure told.
