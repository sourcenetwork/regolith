---- MODULE ClockCache ----
\* ===========================================================================
\* THE STORY
\* ===========================================================================
\* regolith keeps recently read table blocks in a block cache, so a second
\* read of the same block costs no disk read (src/engine/block_cache.rs).
\* The cache has a byte budget. When a new block does not fit, a "hand"
\* walks round the cached entries in a circle (CLOCK) and evicts one:
\*   - an entry read since the hand last passed has its "referenced" bit
\*     set; the hand clears the bit and passes it by, a second chance;
\*   - an entry a reader is holding right now is "pinned": the hand never
\*     evicts it. A reader's pin is a reference to the block, and the hand
\*     evicts only by turning the cache's own lone reference into none in
\*     one compare-and-swap, which fails while any other reference exists.
\* Nothing here takes a lock: every step is one compare-and-swap.
\*
\* Blocks also arrive another way. A thread that must never wait reads
\* through its own I/O queue (CacheOnly reads, src/engine/io): on a miss it
\* records the block on its queue and comes back later. When the read
\* finishes, the block "lands": it goes into the cache, and the queue keeps
\* a reference to it in its landing table, so the read that runs again is
\* sure to find it even if the cache had to evict it meanwhile.
\*
\* Tiny example. The budget holds two blocks. Reader R reads block 1 and
\* holds it. An insert of block 3 needs room: the hand reaches block 1, sees
\* R's pin, and passes; it reaches block 2, nobody holds it, and evicts it.
\* R's block 1 is never freed under R.
\*
\* What can go wrong, and what this model checks cannot happen:
\*   - the hand evicts a block a reader holds, and the block's memory is
\*     freed under the reader (NoFreedPin);
\*   - the cache holds more bytes than its budget (ByteBound);
\*   - the bytes the cache counts drift from what it holds (UsedExact);
\*   - a block that landed for a waiting queue is freed before that queue's
\*     read runs again, so the read finds nothing (LandedReadable);
\*   - a reference is lost or counted twice (RefsExact), which is what all
\*     of the above stand on.
\*
\* WHAT IS MODELLED, and the code each piece mirrors:
\*   cached    the blocks the cache holds: an entry published in a ring
\*             slot and filed in the shard's map (block_cache/ring.rs)
\*   refs      each block's strong count: the cache's own reference, one
\*             per reader holding it, one per landing that names it
\*             (Arc<Block>, the pin; Weak::upgrade takes one)
\*   live      the blocks whose memory exists: read and not yet freed
\*   refbit    the REF flag of the block's slot word
\*   used      the bytes charged against the budget (total_used)
\*   pins      what each reader holds (the Arc<Block> a get returned)
\*   wants     what each queue's CacheOnly read missed and waits for
\*   landed    each queue's landing table (QueueShared::landed)
\*   reran     the waits each queue's read has been run again for (ghost)
\*
\* WHAT IS LEFT OUT, and why that loses nothing:
\*   - Shards. Every shard runs this same protocol on its own slots and
\*     its own share of the budget; the cache-wide total is reserved first,
\*     which is the same bounded compare-and-swap at one more level.
\*   - The map and the slot generations. They decide which slot an entry
\*     lives in, never whether a pin is honoured or bytes are counted.
\*   - Memory ordering and the CAS loops: tests/loom_block_cache.rs checks
\*     those. Here each CAS is one atomic step.
\*   - Explicit removals (a re-insert of a key, evict_file, clear). They
\*     drop the cache's reference whatever readers hold, and a reader keeps
\*     its own, which this model's reference counting already covers.
\*
\* CONFIGURATIONS (each GREEN must pass, each RED must break the one
\* invariant it names):
\*   MC_ClockCache_Green               the real protocol.
\*   MC_ClockCache_Red_IgnorePins      the hand evicts whatever it lands
\*                                     on and frees it: NoFreedPin breaks.
\*   MC_ClockCache_Red_Unbounded       an insert never checks the budget:
\*                                     ByteBound breaks.
\*   MC_ClockCache_Red_LandingUnheld   a landing keeps no reference of its
\*                                     own, so the hand frees what landed:
\*                                     LandedReadable breaks.
\*
\* Lean, proofs/lean/Regolith/ClockCache.lean, proves the same rules for
\* every number of blocks, readers and queues.

\* Numbers and finite sets.
EXTENDS Naturals, FiniteSets

\* The fixed inputs of a configuration.
CONSTANTS
  \* The blocks that may be read.
  Blocks,
  \* The reader threads (Blocking reads that pin what they get).
  Readers,
  \* The I/O queues of threads that never wait (CacheOnly reads).
  Queues,
  \* [Blocks -> Nat]: what each block costs the budget.

  \* The byte budget.
  Cap,
  \* "Green" for the real code, or the name of one planted bug.
  Mode

\* The bug names this model knows.
ASSUME Mode \in {"Green", "IgnorePins", "Unbounded", "LandingUnheld"}
\* Sizes and the budget are numbers.

  landed,
  \* [Queues -> SUBSET Blocks]: the waits already run again (a ghost that
  \* keeps each wait to one round, so the model is finite).
  reran

\* Every variable, so a step that changes none of them is a stutter.
vars == <<cached, refs, live, refbit, used, pins, wants, landed, reran>>

\* The sum of the sizes of a set of blocks, one block at a time.

\* A Blocking read of block b misses: the reader reads it from the table,
\* keeps it (its pin), and offers it to the cache. The cache takes it only
\* if it fits; a refused block is the reader's alone.
Miss(r, b) ==
  \* A block not in memory, which this reader does not hold.

\* One step of the hand landing on cached block b. On a pass that honours
\* reference bits (forced = FALSE) a set bit is cleared and the entry kept.
\* Otherwise the hand evicts the entry only if the cache's reference is the

\* Invariants.

\* Every variable holds what its comment says.
TypeOK ==
  \* Only blocks are cached ...
  /\ cached \subseteq Blocks
  \* ... or in memory.
  /\ live \subseteq Blocks
  \* Every block has a count ...
  /\ refs \in [Blocks -> Nat]
  \* ... the charge is a number ...
  /\ used \in Nat
  \* ... readers hold blocks ...
  /\ pins \in [Readers -> SUBSET Blocks]
  \* ... and landings name blocks.
  /\ landed \in [Queues -> SUBSET Blocks]

\* THE HEADLINE. A block a reader holds is never freed: the hand never
\* evicts a pinned block out from under it. Rules out: R gets block 1, the
\* hand needs room, takes block 1 and frees it while R reads its bytes.
\* Lean: evict_only_unpinned, reachable_safe.
NoFreedPin ==
  \* Everything every reader holds is in memory.
  \A r \in Readers : pins[r] \subseteq live

\* The cache never holds more bytes than its budget. Rules out: two inserts
\* each see room for one more block and both go in. Lean: reserve_bounded,
\* reachable_safe.
ByteBound ==
  \* The charge is within the budget.
  used <= Cap

\* The bytes counted are exactly the bytes of what is cached, so the bound
\* above is a bound on what the cache really holds. Lean: reachable_safe.
UsedExact ==
  \* The charge is the sum of the cached blocks' sizes.
  used = SumSize(cached)

\* A block that landed for a queue stays readable until that queue's read
\* runs again. Rules out: a CacheOnly read's block lands, the cache evicts
\* it before the owner polls, and the read finds nothing and misses again,
\* forever. Lean: reachable_safe.
LandedReadable ==
  \* Everything that landed for every queue is in memory.
  \A q \in Queues : landed[q] \subseteq live

\* Every block's count is exactly its holders: the cache, the readers, the
\* landings. Lean: reachable_safe (refs_exact).
RefsExact ==
  \* For every block: the count is the cache's one (if cached) ...
  \A b \in Blocks :
    \* ... plus one per holder, plus one per landing.
    refs[b] = (IF b \in cached THEN 1 ELSE 0) + Holders(b) + Landings(b)
