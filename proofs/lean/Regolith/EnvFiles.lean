# EnvFiles: a read sees every write that finished before it

This file backs the TLA+ model `proofs/tla/EnvFiles.tla`. TLC checks the
protocol there for two or three writers and a reader or two. Here the same
rules are proved for every number of readers, writers and steps.

## The story, for a reader who has never seen the code

regolith reads and writes files through an `Env`. Every `Env` must keep one
rule: a read sees the bytes of every write that finished before it began,
at the offset it asked for.

Part 1, the disk. An open file has one shared "cursor". Reading by "seek,
then read" is two steps on that one cursor, so two readers can step on each
other: A seeks to 0, B seeks to 1, A reads at 1. A positional read (`pread`,
`StdReadFile` in `src/env/std_env.rs`) names its offset in one call.

Part 2, a file in memory (`MemFile`, `src/env/mem_file.rs`). The file is a
buffer (an *extent*) with a published length; readers read below it with no
lock. An append that fits takes a WRITER flag, writes its record at the
length, and publishes length + 1. Anything else builds a new extent from the
old one's published records plus its own, FREEZES the old extent (no append
may publish there after that), and swaps the new extent in. A writer whose
publish meets a freeze writes again, on the new extent.

## What is proved, in plain words

1. `positional_reads_own`: with positional reads, every disk reader gets
   the bytes at its own offset, whatever the order (TLA+ `ReadsOwnBytes`).
2. `current_holds_finished`: every append that finished is in the current
   extent's published records (TLA+ `CurrentHoldsFinished`).
3. `read_sees_finished`: a memory read that began after an append finished
   returns that append's record (TLA+ `ReadSeesFinished`).
4. The RED cases, as counterexamples: a shared cursor hands a reader
   another offset's bytes (`shared_cursor_reads_other`); a copy that swaps
   without freezing loses a finished append (`no_freeze_loses_append`).

## How to read the Lean

`def` defines a thing, `theorem` states a fact and its proof follows
`:= by`. Lines starting with `--` are comments, in plain words. A proof is a
list of *tactics*; each one changes the goal still to be shown, and the
comment above it says how. `simp` rewrites with known facts; `omega` solves
arithmetic over natural numbers; `cases` splits on the ways a fact could be
true; `induction` proves a fact for every number of steps by proving it for
none and then for one more.

/-- **`no_freeze_loses_append`.** Without the freeze, a finished append can
be missing from the current extent. The story: writer 1 takes WRITER on
extent 0 and writes its record at position 0; writer 2 builds a copy of
extent 0 (length 0, so just its own record) and swaps it in as extent 1;
writer 1 then publishes on extent 0, which nobody reads any more. Both
appends finished, and extent 1 holds only writer 2's record. -/
