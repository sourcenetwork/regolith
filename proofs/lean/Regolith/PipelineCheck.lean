# PipelineCheck: the check a slot runs when it is decided

## The story

Two threads commit at the same moment. Both read key 1 at snapshot 0, both
write key 1. If they commit one after the other, the second one notices that
key 1 changed after its snapshot and aborts, so the first one's write is not
lost.

The commit pipeline (`src/engine/commit`) gives every commit a slot of a
ring and decides the slots strictly in ring order. A slot's writes are in the
memtable before the next slot is decided (`AppliedBeforePassed` in
`proofs/tla/CommitPipeline.tla`), so the check of a slot reads a store that
already holds every write decided before it. A plain write (`Db::put`, which
is never checked) lands the same way, so a transaction behind it sees it too.

This file proves, for every number of slots and every read and write set:

1. `landed_write_is_seen`, `no_lost_update`, `later_slot_aborts` (TLA+
   `NoLostUpdate`): a write that landed is in the store every later slot is
   checked against, so a later transaction that touched its key from an
   older snapshot aborts, whatever slots stand between them and after them.
2. `abort_has_cause` (`AbortsHaveCause`): a slot aborts only when it is a
   transaction and the store holds a newer version of a key it touched.
3. `conflict_stays`: a conflict found among some versions is still a
   conflict once more versions land, which is why a transaction whose early
   check fails aborts at once, without taking a slot.
4. `early_check_split`, `early_check_cover`: the check is split in two
   (`src/engine/commit/early.rs`). Before it takes a slot a transaction
   checks itself, on its own thread, against the versions up to a horizon `h`
   it sampled, and whichever thread decides its slot then looks only above
   `h`. The two halves decide as one check of every version.
   `store_below_ceiling`, `ceiling_skips_the_check_above`,
   `skip_on_ceiling_is_one_check`: no version is newer than the last
   sequence handed out (the ceiling), so when that is at or below `h` the
   look above `h` finds nothing and the decision skips it; RED
   `skip_on_published_loses_an_update` guards the skip with the published
   horizon instead and loses an update (`MC_CommitPipeline_Red_SkipOnPublished`).
5. The RED case as a concrete counterexample:
   `published_only_loses_an_update`, a slot checked against a view that lacks
   an earlier slot's writes (`MC_CommitPipeline_Red_ValidatePublished`), and
   beside it `plain_write_is_seen`.

The sequences the slots take are `Regolith/Pipeline.lean`; who may take
which step is `Regolith/PipelineHelping.lean`. TLC checks the interleavings
of a few threads around these laws; the theorems here hold for every size.

## How to read the Lean

`def` defines a function or a property. `theorem` states a fact; its proof
follows `:= by` as a list of tactic steps, each of which changes the goal (what
is left to prove). Every line carries a `--` comment saying what it does.

thread decides the slot then looks at every version above `h`. Together they
decide as one check of every version. When nothing was made visible since
the snapshot (`h` is the snapshot), the code loads no view at all: `early`

/-! ## Nothing handed out above the horizon: the look above it is skipped -/

/-
The code (`RegolithEngine::validate` and `decide_txn` in
`src/engine/commit`) knows `ceiling`, the last sequence handed out before the
slot it decides (`base.next_seq - 1`). When `ceiling` is at or below the
horizon `h` of the transaction's early check, it does not look above `h` at
all. Story: a baker serves ticket 6 and knows the last ticket served before
it was ticket 5; the customer already checked the board up to ticket 5. There
is nothing newer to look at, so nobody walks to the board again. The three
facts below say why that is exact: the store never holds a version above the
last sequence handed out, so the look above `h` finds nothing, so the check
is the early check alone.
-/

/-- **The ceiling bounds the store.** When no version in the store is newer
than `s`, the last sequence handed out, none is newer than the last sequence
handed out after any number of slots are decided: a slot that lands puts its
writes at the next sequence, which becomes the last one handed out. Every
sequence the code hands out goes through the pipeline's state
(`After::next_seq`: a slot's operations, a counter reservation, an ingest's,
a rollback's floor), so this is the code's `ceiling`. -/

/-- **RED SkipOnPublished.** The skip guarded by the published horizon. Slot
1 committed key 1 at sequence 1 and is not published yet, so the published
horizon is 0, and so is the horizon of the early check of a transaction that
read key 1 at snapshot 0: its early view holds nothing. The broken guard
(published 0 at or below horizon 0) skips, finds no conflict, and the
transaction commits over slot 1's write: a lost update. The ceiling (1) is
above the horizon, so the design looks and aborts it, as the one check does.
