# IngestDurability: an ingest that survives keeps every commit before it (D48)

This file backs the TLA+ model `proofs/tla/IngestDurability.tla`, invariant
`GapFreePrefix` (configurations `MC_IngestDurability_Green` and
`MC_IngestDurability_Red_NoLogSync`). The model checks three commits racing
one ingest; this file proves the law for any number of commits.

## The story, with a tiny example

Under `Eventual` durability a commit's record goes into the write-ahead log
and nobody waits for it to reach the disk. A power cut must still leave a
gap-free prefix of commit order: if commit 5 survives, commits 0 to 4 do too.

An ingest is a commit in that order too: it draws its place under the
commit pipeline's mutex, like any commit. But it is made durable by its own
channel, the synced manifest batch that adds its table, not by the log.

Example: commit `c0` writes `a = 1` into the log, unsynced. Then an ingest
takes its place after `c0` and syncs its manifest batch. If the power goes
out now, the ingest survives (its batch is on the disk) while `c0` is lost
(its log record never was). Reads would show the ingest but not the commit
ordered before it: a gap.

The fix (`RegolithEngine::sync_active_wal` in `src/engine/ingest.rs`): under
the mutex, before its manifest batch, the ingest syncs the log, so every
commit ordered before it is on the disk first.

## What is proved, in plain words

1. `step_inv` and `reachable_inv`: the fixed protocol keeps its invariant:
   the durable commits are a prefix, and once the ingest is installed, every
   commit before its place is durable.
2. `surviving_ingest_keeps_prefix`: so after a power cut at any moment, if
   the ingest survives, every commit ordered before it survives, and what
   survives is a gap-free prefix of commit order.
3. `no_log_sync_loses_commit`: without the log sync, one commit, the
   ingest, and a power cut leave the ingest without the commit before it.
   This is the RED configuration as a concrete counterexample.
