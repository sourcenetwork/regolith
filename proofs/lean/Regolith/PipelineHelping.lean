# PipelineHelping: a stopped thread holds nobody up

This file backs the TLA+ model `proofs/tla/CommitPipeline.tla`, the safety
half of its liveness properties `LockFree` and `EveryLiveCommitCompletes`,
its invariant `NoLiveThreadBlocked`, and its RED `StopHoldsClaim`. The
sequence numbering and the publication order of the same pipeline are in
`Regolith/Pipeline.lean`.

## The story

The commit pipeline keeps commits in a ring of slots (`src/engine/commit`).
Think of a bakery with a ticket machine: every commit pulls a numbered
ticket, and whoever stands at the counter does the next step of the next
order, its own or somebody else's. So a customer who wanders off holds
nobody up: the next one finishes their order for them.

A slot goes through stages. Each step that moves it one stage on may be
taken by any thread whose own slot is the same one or a later one. Each
step has an ordering rule, and every rule looks back only: at the slots
before this one, and at whether the round (the one claim on the log's
device step) is free. None looks at a later slot, and none names a thread.

Tiny example: thread A pulled ticket 1 and stopped for good before writing
its order down. Thread B, at ticket 2, finds ticket 1 empty and throws it
away (that settles it), passes it, and then takes its own commit through
every stage. B never waits for A.

## What is proved, for every number of slots and every mix of stages

1. `first_unfinished_can_step`: with every earlier slot finished and the
   round free, whatever step a slot needs next may be taken.
2. `step_advances`, `no_step_goes_back`: a step moves a slot exactly one
   stage on; no step of any thread moves any slot back.
3. `helper_step_makes_progress`: while work is left, the next step of the
   first unfinished slot is enabled, and taking it leaves exactly one step
   fewer to take.
4. `helper_alone_finishes`: one thread running alone finishes every slot
   up to its own, wherever every other thread stopped: the safety half of
   lock-freedom.
5. `helping_is_bounded` (E21): that takes at most eight steps a slot, so no
   thread serves an unbounded queue of others.
6. `held_round_blocks`: the one exception, stated and proved. A thread that
   stops while it holds the round stops the commits that wait for the
   sync, which is why the pipeline treats the holder as doing device I/O.
7. `run_step_counts`, `run_never_goes_back`: records reach the log in runs
   (`src/engine/commit/write_unit.rs`): one step of one thread, the holder
   of the write unit, takes the write step of several slots at once. That
   step moves each slot it writes one stage on and no slot back, and
   leaves exactly as many steps fewer as it wrote records. So the safety
   half of lock-freedom stands with runs: a run is many helper steps taken
   together, and the count of steps left only falls.
8. `a_park_is_bounded`, `patience_bounds_the_wait`: a thread whose record
   is in another thread's hands (the unit's holder, or an owner that has
   not encoded its record yet) parks, and after a bounded number of its own
   steps it writes the record itself, whatever every other thread does,
   the holder that stopped for good included. Wakes from other threads only
   shorten that (`wakes_only_shorten`). So the write step of the first
   unfinished slot is always within reach of one live thread, and
   `helper_alone_finishes` keeps its meaning. `without_patience_waits_for_a_wake`
   says why the patience is there: without it a parked thread needs another
   thread to wake it (the TLA+ RED `LostWake`).

The rule that changed: a thread writes the records up to its own, and a run
it writes as the unit's holder may reach past its own, by one run at most,
bounded in records and bytes (P5 in `pipeline.rs`, WU6 in `write_unit.rs`);
`helping_is_bounded` bounds the steps for the slots up to its own, and the
run past it adds one step.

What stays in TLA+: that the interleavings of several threads keep
finishing slots (the liveness half). TLC checks it for two and three
threads.

How to read the Lean: `def` defines a function or a property, `theorem`
states a fact and its proof follows `:= by`. Lines starting with `--` are
comments. Inside a proof, each step is commented with what it establishes.

owners encoded their records; the holder writes all three with one write.

/-! ## The write unit: a park is bounded

A thread that needs a record written finds it in another thread's hands:
the unit's holder is writing a run, or the record's owner has not encoded
it yet. It spins about as long as one write takes, then parks on the
record. It wakes when another thread writes the record (the holder's run,
or a copy) or when its patience runs out; then it writes the record itself,
as a copy through the gate (`write_unit.rs`, WU5).

Tiny example, with a patience of two slices: the holder stops for good with
the unit. The waiter spins (one step), parks with two slices left, one
slice passes, the other passes, its patience is out, it writes the record:
five steps of its own, and nobody else did anything. -/
