# OpenFileTable: at most `cap` open files, never one closed under a reader

This file backs the TLA+ model `proofs/tla/OpenFileTable.tla`. TLC checks
the protocol there for one or two slots and two or three threads. Here the
same rules are proved for every number of slots, threads and steps.

## The story, for a reader who has never seen the code

With `max_open_files` set, regolith keeps every open table file in a small
table of *slots* (`SlotTable`, `src/env/open_file_limit/slots.rs`), one file
per slot, `cap` slots. A read that finds its table in a slot *joins* the slot
(it counts as one more reader of it); a read that does not *claims* a slot
nobody is reading, closes the file there, opens its own, and reads.

Tiny example. One slot. Thread 1 opened table A there and is reading it.
Thread 2 wants table B: it may not take the slot while thread 1 reads, or
thread 1 would read a closed file. Once thread 1 leaves, thread 2 claims the
slot, closes A, opens B. Thread 1, back for A, sees B in the slot and must
claim the slot again: it must never read B by mistake.

The join is one compare-and-swap (CAS) on the slot's state word, which holds
the phase and the reader count but not the owner. So the code checks the
owner again AFTER its CAS: counted as a reader, nobody can claim the slot,
and the owner it sees then is final. In this file a join may join ANY open
slot, whatever it holds: that is every join the CAS can let through (and
more), so the proofs cover the CAS's whole gap.

## What is proved, in plain words

1. `open_le_cap`: never more open files than slots (TLA+ `AtMostCap`).
2. `never_closes_in_use`: the file a thread is reading through sits, open,
   in its slot until it leaves (TLA+ `NeverClosedInUse`).
3. `reads_own_file`: a read returns the table its thread asked for (TLA+
   `ReadsOwnFile`).
4. The RED cases, as counterexamples: a claim that ignores readers closes a
   file in use (`ignore_readers_closes_in_use`); a join with no owner check
   reads another table (`no_recheck_reads_other`); a thread that opens its
   file outside the table goes over the limit (`outside_table_over_cap`).

## How to read the Lean

`def` defines a thing, `theorem` states a fact and its proof follows
`:= by`. Lines starting with `--` are comments, in plain words. A proof is a
list of *tactics*; each one changes the goal still to be shown, and the
comment above it says how. `simp` rewrites with known facts; `omega` solves
arithmetic over natural numbers; `cases` splits on the ways a fact could be
true; `induction` proves a fact for every number of steps by proving it for
none and then for one more.
