# ClockCache: the lock-free CLOCK block cache never evicts a pinned block

This file backs the TLA+ model `proofs/tla/ClockCache.tla`, invariants
`NoFreedPin`, `ByteBound`, `UsedExact`, `LandedReadable` and `RefsExact`
(configurations `MC_ClockCache_*`).

## The story

The block cache (`src/engine/block_cache.rs`) keeps table blocks under a
byte budget. A block's strong count is its references: one for the cache's
entry, one per reader holding it, one per I/O queue whose landing table
names it. A reader pins a block by taking a reference. The CLOCK hand
evicts an entry only by turning the count from exactly one (the cache's) to
zero in one compare-and-swap, so it never evicts a block anyone else holds,
and the block's memory is freed exactly when its count reaches zero. Every
insert reserves its bytes against the budget in one bounded
compare-and-swap.

Tiny example: block 1 is cached and reader A holds it, so its count is 2.
The hand's swap from 1 to 0 fails, and block 1 stays. When A lets go the
count is 1, and the next pass evicts it and frees it.

## What is proved, for any number of readers, queues and blocks

1. `evict_only_unpinned`: an eviction succeeds only on a block no reader
   holds and no landing names.
2. `reachable_safe`: every block reachable through any sequence of hits,
   drops, landings, re-runs, inserts and evictions keeps its count exact,
   and a block someone holds or a landing names is in memory
   (`NoFreedPin`, `LandedReadable`, `RefsExact`).
3. `reserve_bounded` and `two_level_bounded`: a bounded reservation never
   takes a total past its budget, and the cache's two-level reservation
   (the cache-wide total first, then the shard) keeps every shard's bytes
   within the total and the total within the budget (`ByteBound`).
4. `used_exact`: inserting and evicting entries keeps the bytes counted
   equal to the bytes of what is cached (`UsedExact`).
5. The RED cases as counterexamples: an eviction that ignores pins frees a
   held block (`ignore_pins_breaks`), an unchecked reservation passes the
   budget (`unbounded_breaks`), and a landing with no reference of its own
   is freed by an eviction (`landing_unheld_breaks`).
