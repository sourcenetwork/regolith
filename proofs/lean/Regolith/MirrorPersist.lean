# MirrorPersist: OPFS mirror mode writes its batches back one at a time, in order

THE STORY. A database opened on a browser's main thread lives in memory
(`MirrorFs`, `src/env/opfs/mirror.rs`) and reaches OPFS only when the app
calls `OpfsEnv::persist` (`src/env/opfs/mod.rs:322`). One call is one batch:
it captures the dirty files and the names owed a removal, writes the files
whole (tables first, the MANIFEST last: `persist_rank`,
`src/env/persist_order.rs:17`), removes the owed names, and settles: each
written version counts as persisted, each removed name stops being owed.
Every browser call is a promise the batch awaits, and other code runs while
it waits: the engine, and another `persist` call.

Tiny example of what goes wrong without the lock (`persist_lock`,
mirror.rs:328). Batch A captures MANIFEST version 1 and starts writing it.
The engine appends an edit: version 2. Batch B captures version 2, writes
it, and the write lands. Then A's write lands: OPFS holds version 1 again,
older than what it held a moment before.

WHAT IS PROVED, for every size:

1. `serial_never_older` and `serial_monotone`: with the lock taken before
   the capture and held until the batch ends, no step of any run, of any
   length, lowers the MANIFEST version OPFS holds: any number of edits,
   batches and failures. `overlap_stores_older` is the RED: let a second
   batch capture while the first one's write is still to land (no lock, a
   batch dropped with its lock, or a capture before the lock), and five
   steps take OPFS from version 2 back to 1.
2. `failed_removal_stays_owed` and `failure_keeps_every_name`: a batch in
   which one removal failed with anything but NotFoundError ends before
   settle, so every name owed before it, the failed one included, is still
   owed after it, for any number of names. `all_gone_clears` is the other
   half: when every removal worked or found no entry, every captured name
   stops being owed. `swallow_loses_failed` is the RED of the code before
   #289, which counted the failure as done. `strict_owed_forever` is the
   RED the other way: count NotFoundError as a failure, and a name whose
   entry is already gone stays owed after every retry.
3. `cut_short_keeps_lower`: in a batch in persist order (no call after one
   of a higher rank), whatever prefix of it ran (a tab closed, or a call
   failed and the batch returned), every call of a lower rank than one that
   ran also ran. So `cut_short_keeps_tables`: once the MANIFEST is written,
   every table of the batch is; and `cut_short_keeps_writes`: once a
   removal ran, every write of the batch went through, the MANIFEST
   included. `batch_ordered` shows that the code's batch, its writes sorted
   by rank and then its removals, is in persist order.
   `manifest_first_not_ordered`, `manifest_first_loses_table` and
   `removal_first_loses_manifest` are the REDs.

BACKS `proofs/tla/MirrorPersist.tla`, which checks every interleaving of two
batches, the engine and the browser in a small run: `INV_ManifestMonotone`
there is `serial_never_older` here for runs of every length,
`INV_RemovalOwed` is `failed_removal_stays_owed`, `INV_ManifestNamesStored`
rests on `cut_short_keeps_tables` and `cut_short_keeps_writes`. Of the RED
configurations there, `NoLock`, `NoKeepAlive` and `CaptureFirst` are
`overlap_stores_older` here, `SwallowRemoval` is `swallow_loses_failed`,
`NotFoundFails` is `strict_owed_forever`, `ManifestFirst` is
`manifest_first_not_ordered` and `manifest_first_loses_table`, and
`DeleteFirst` and `DeleteAfterFailedWrite` are
`removal_first_loses_manifest`. `NoRetry`, a caller who stops calling, is a
run that ends, which only the TLA+ model's liveness check can show.

How to read the Lean: `def` defines a function or a property, `inductive`
lists the ways something can be built or can happen, `theorem` states a fact
and its proof follows `:= by` or `:=`. Lines starting with `--` are comments;
each proof step is commented.
