# TombstoneRetirement: dropping a tombstone nobody needs changes no read (E27)

This file backs the TLA+ model `proofs/tla/TombstoneRetirement.tla`,
invariants `SnapshotReadsKept` and `HeadKept` (configurations
`MC_TombstoneRetirement_Green`, `MC_TombstoneRetirement_Red_IgnoreSnapshots`
and `MC_TombstoneRetirement_Red_IgnoreDeeper`). The model checks two keys and
four writes; this file proves the law for any keys, writes and snapshots.

## The story, with a tiny example

A range tombstone says "every key from `lo` to `hi` is deleted, as of
sequence `s`". Dropping a column family writes one. If compaction carried it
forever, every later pass over its range would pay for it (E27).

A compaction pass merges two adjacent runs, a window `W`. It already drops
every put that a tombstone of `W` hides in the put's own snapshot stripe
(`Stripes::shadowed`). The fix also drops ("retires") a tombstone of `W`
when (1) no deeper run holds anything in its range, and (2) every live
snapshot is at or above its sequence (`Retirement::carried_tombstones`,
`src/engine/compaction/retire.rs`).

Example: key 7 was put at sequence 1, then a tombstone over 5..9 at
sequence 3. With no snapshot below 3 and nothing deeper, the pass drops the
put (hidden) and the tombstone (retired): key 7 reads absent before and
after. With a snapshot at 2, the put stays (that snapshot still sees it),
and so must the tombstone, or a read at the head would find the put again.

## What is proved, in plain words

1. `retire_keeps_reads`: for every key and every read point that is a live
   snapshot or the head, the put that wins the read is the same before and
   after the pass.
2. `retire_keeps_read_value`: so the value read is the same.
3. `ignore_snapshots_breaks_reads` and `ignore_deeper_breaks_reads`: drop
   either condition and a read at the head changes. These are the RED
   configurations as concrete counterexamples.

## What the proof assumes, and where the engine provides it

- Everything above the window (the memtables and newer runs, `A`) is newer
  than everything in it: entries enter at the top and a pass merges
  adjacent runs (`LsmOrder.lean`).
- A read point is a live snapshot, or the head, which is at or above every
  sequence.

/-! ## The pass -/

/-- `Stripes::shadowed`: put `e` of window `W` is hidden by a tombstone `t` of
`W` in `e`'s own snapshot stripe: `t` covers `e`'s key, is newer than `e`,
and is no newer than any live snapshot at or above `e` (the top of `e`'s
stripe). The pass drops it. -/
