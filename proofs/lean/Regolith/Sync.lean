# Sync: the barging lock with bounded bypass (regolith::sync, D49)

This file backs the TLA+ model `proofs/tla/Sync.tla`, invariants
`MutualExclusion`, `BoundedBypass`, `HandoffExclusive` and `NoLostWakeup`
(configurations `MC_Sync_*`), the exclusive side of
`proofs/tla/SyncRwLock.tla` and the turn semaphore of
`proofs/tla/SyncOnce.tla`. TLC checks the concurrent protocol there, one
machine instruction at a time, for two or three tasks. Here the Mutex is a
sequential state machine over the same steps taken whole (barging fast
path, enqueue, release, four kinds of poll, two kinds of cancel); a
reachable state is the result of any sequence of them, so every
interleaving of those steps is covered. The theorems hold for every number
of requests, every number of steps and every bound `B` of at least 1 (the
code's `MAX_BYPASS`: 16 in the engine, 2 under loom).

## The story, for a reader who has never seen the code

A lock lets one task at a time into a piece of code. regolith's async locks
(src/sync/) let a task take the lock whenever it is free, even when others
are queued for it ("barging"): the alternative, handing the lock to the
longest waiter, leaves it idle until that sleeping task is scheduled.

Tiny example of what barging can do: task A waits. Every time the lock is
released A is woken, but task B, already running, grabs the lock first.
A loses the race again and again. So a waiter counts the races it loses.
The retry that would be its `B`-th loss does two things in one indivisible
step: it finds the lock taken, and it raises a flag that says "a handoff is
owed". While the flag is up nobody may barge, and the release that follows
hands the lock straight to that waiter.

What could go wrong: two holders at once; a waiter that loses for ever; a
newcomer slipping in while a handoff is owed; a waiter asleep beside a free
lock. The theorems below rule each of these out for the abstract lock, for
any number of requests.

## The steps, and the code each one stands for

* `fast`: `Contend::poll`'s first try (`Lock::try_take`, also `try_lock`):
  one compare-and-swap takes a free lock when no handoff is owed, whoever
  waits.
* `enqueue`: the try failed, so the caller queues at the tail with a count
  of 0 (`Lock::enqueue`).
* `release`: a guard is dropped (`RawSemaphore::release`) and the drain
  pass that follows runs (`RawSemaphore::pass`). With no handoff owed the
  lock is free and the head is nudged (woken). With a handoff owed the
  pass takes the lock for the head and grants it.
* `pollHanded`: a waiter that was granted the lock is polled and holds it.
* `pollWin`: a nudged waiter's retry takes the free lock.
* `pollLose`: a nudged waiter's retry finds the lock taken, below the
  bound: the count goes up by one (`Contend::bypass`).
* `pollOwe`: the retry that would be the `B`-th loss (`Lock::take_or_owe`)
  finds the lock taken: the count reaches `B` and the owed flag goes up,
  in the same step.
* `cancelWaiting`, `cancelHanded`: the waiting future is dropped
  (`Contend::cancel`). A nudge it carried passes to the new head; a lock it
  had been granted is released like any other.

Three things are simpler here than in the code, and why that is sound for
these theorems. The release and the drain pass after it are one step: while
a handoff is owed nobody can take what the release freed (theorem
`owed_blocks_barging`), so nothing can happen in between that these laws
could see. The owed flag names its waiter: the code keeps a bit (HANDOFF)
and a count of waiters marked owed; with one permit only the head is ever
nudged, so only the head can be the one. And there is no drain role: who
runs the pass, and how many passes one thread runs, is not in this machine
at all. That last bound (`DrainBounded` in `Sync.tla`: one pass, plus one
for each waiter operation or release with a node queued that lands on it)
is checked in TLA+ only, where the drain is modelled instruction by
instruction.

## What is proved, in plain words

1. `step_inv` and `reachable_inv`: the invariant holds in every reachable
   state.
2. `mutual_exclusion`: at most one request holds the lock, and none while
   it is free. TLA+: `MutualExclusion`.
3. `bounded_bypass`, `lose_below_bound`, `bypass_counts_losses`,
   `owed_at_bound`, `at_bound_owed`: a queued request's count never exceeds
   `B`; a loss happens only below `B`; only a loss changes a request's
   count, by one; the loss that brings the count to `B` raises the owed
   flag in the same step; and a waiter whose count is `B` is owed. So a
   request loses at most `B` races. TLA+: `BoundedBypass`.
4. `release_hands_off_at_bound`: once a waiter is owed, the release that
   follows hands it the lock.
5. `owed_exclusive` and `owed_blocks_barging`: while a handoff is owed the
   lock is not free and nobody competes for it, and no step makes anyone
   but the owed waiter an owner. TLA+: `HandoffExclusive`.
6. `no_stranded_head` and `handed_woken`: while the lock is free, the head
   waiter has been woken; a request handed the lock has been woken.
   TLA+: `NoLostWakeup`.
7. The RED cases, as counterexamples: `unbounded_barging_breaks_bound` and
   `unbounded_barging_leaves_barging_open` (a waiter that never raises the
   owed flag loses more than `B` races, with barging still open) and
   `release_without_wake_strands` (a release that wakes nobody leaves the
   head asleep beside a free lock).

`Regolith/LockTable.lean` builds the pessimistic lock table on this
machine: it uses `M`, `init`, `Step`, `Steps`, the four laws
`mutual_exclusion`, `bounded_bypass`, `no_stranded_head` and
`handed_woken`, the helper `eq_single_of_mem`, and the RED relation
`StepsNoHand` with `unbounded_barging_breaks_bound`. Those keep their names
and their statements here.

How to read the Lean: `def` defines a function or a property, `theorem`
states a fact and its proof follows `:= by`. Lines starting with `--` are
comments. `l.erase x` is `l` without its first `x`. `grind` is Lean's
automatic prover: it is given the facts in scope and must find the
argument itself; the comment above each use says what that argument is.
