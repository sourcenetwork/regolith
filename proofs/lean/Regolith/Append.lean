# Append: commit-ordered positions are dense, once per key, in commit order (plan 3.6)

This file backs two TLA+ models in `proofs/tla`:

* `CommitOrderedAppend.tla`, invariants `INV_Dense`, `INV_UniqueCursors`,
  `INV_AtMostOnce`, `INV_CommitOrder` and `INV_NoSkip` (configurations
  `MC_CommitOrderedAppend_Green_*`), and the REDs
  `MC_CommitOrderedAppend_Red_ViewOnlyHead`,
  `MC_CommitOrderedAppend_Red_AssignBeforeValidation` and
  `MC_CommitOrderedAppend_Red_Stamps`;
* `CommitOrderedAppendCrash.tla`, invariants `INV_Dense`,
  `INV_UniqueCursors` and `INV_AtMostOnce` after a crash, since recovery
  keeps a prefix of the commit order.

## The story, for a reader who has never seen the code

A log is a numbered list that only grows, and many transactions add to it
at once. `Transaction::append(log, entry, once_key)`
(src/transaction/append.rs) does not choose the entry's number: it only
queues the entry. The number is given out at the very end of the commit, in
the one step that handles one transaction at a time ("the ordered step",
`AppendOrder::number` in src/engine/commit/append.rs), after the
transaction's reads were checked. Each append gets the log's next position,
head + 1, unless its once key already holds a position.

Tiny example: writers A and B each append one entry while the head says 0.
In the ordered step A is numbered first and gets 1, and B, counting from
the head A left, gets 2. If A's commit is refused instead, A takes no
number and B gets 1.

What could go wrong: two entries with one number, a number nobody uses (a
hole), numbers that do not follow commit order, or one message appended
twice. TLC checks the interleavings for a few writers; the theorems here
show none of these can happen for any number of commits, appends and once
keys.

What is proved, in plain words:

1. `reachable_inv`: the ordered step keeps four facts about the log,
   whatever commits it decides and whichever of them fail validation.
2. `dense_from_one`: the positions, in the order they were assigned, are
   exactly 1, 2, ..., head.
3. `unique_positions`: no two rows share a position.
4. `at_most_once`: no two rows carry one once key, whether the two appends
   came from two transactions or from one.
5. `commit_order`: a smaller position belongs to an earlier commit, or to
   an earlier append of the same commit.
6. `snapshot_sees_prefix`: a snapshot sees the commits up to some point in
   commit order (visibility follows sequence order). With H the head it
   reads, it sees exactly the rows of the whole log at positions 1..H, and
   every one of them. A crash that keeps a prefix of the commit order
   leaves the same kind of state.
7. `view_only_head_duplicates`, `assign_before_validation_leaves_hole` and
   `stamps_leave_hole`: three REDs as concrete counterexamples.

Group commit needs no separate statement. A group's members are decided
one after another, each reading the head and the once keys the earlier
members left, which is exactly folding the ordered step over them; the
first counterexample shows what goes wrong when a member does not.

How to read the Lean: `def` defines a function or a property, `theorem`
states a fact and its proof follows `:= by`. Lines starting with `--` are
comments. A once key and a position are plain natural numbers.

/-- `fresh rows o`: an append passing once key `o` gets a row. It does when
it passes no once key, or when no row carries that key yet. The rows
include those of earlier members of the same group and earlier appends of
the same transaction, because they were assigned first. -/
