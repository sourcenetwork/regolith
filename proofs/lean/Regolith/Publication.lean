# Publication: the visible sequence never passes a pending slot (E8)

This file backs the TLA+ model `proofs/tla/IngestPublication.tla`,
invariant `RepeatableSnapshot` (configurations
`MC_IngestPublication_Green`, `MC_IngestPublication_Red_IngestPublishesEarly`
and `MC_IngestPublication_Red_CommitPassesSlot`).

## The story, for a reader who has never seen the code

Every write gets a sequence number from one shared counter. A reader takes
a snapshot by noting the newest sequence it may see, the "horizon"
(`ReadHorizon::visible`, src/engine/read_horizon.rs), and from then on
ignores everything newer. An "ingest" adds a whole ready-made table of keys
under one sequence number, and installing that table takes a while
(`RegolithEngine::install`, src/engine/ingest.rs).

Tiny example of what can go wrong: the ingest draws sequence 1 and is still
installing. A commit draws sequence 2 and raises the horizon to 2. A reader
takes a snapshot at 2 and reads an ingested key: absent. Then the table
lands, at sequence 1, below the snapshot. The same reader, through the same
snapshot, now finds the key. A snapshot that changes is not a snapshot.

The rule: the horizon never passes a sequence whose data is not installed
yet (a "pending slot"). The engine keeps it by holding one mutex from an
ingest's draw to its publication, the same mutex a commit draws and
publishes under. What is proved here: with the rule, a snapshot reads every
key the same for ever; without it, the example above happens.

What is proved, in plain words:

1. `step_inv` and `reachable_inv`: the fixed protocol keeps every pending
   slot above the horizon. That is its invariant.
2. `repeatable_snapshot`: under the fixed protocol, a snapshot taken at any
   moment reads every key the same at every later moment, whatever commits,
   ingests and publications happen in between.
3. `early_publication_breaks_snapshots`: when the horizon may pass a
   pending slot, a snapshot reads a key absent and later present. This is
   the RED configuration as a concrete counterexample, and the fixed
   protocol refuses the publication that causes it
   (`fixed_protocol_refuses_early_publication`).

Reads use `newestIn` from `LsmOrder.lean`. Over an ordered LSM tree a read
returns the newest visible version across all sources (`read_newest`), so a
single list of installed versions stands for all of them here.
