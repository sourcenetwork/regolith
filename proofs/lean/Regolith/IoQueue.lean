# IoQueue: per-thread I/O queues and single-flight reads (D53)

This file backs the TLA+ model `proofs/tla/NonBlocking.tla`. TLC checks the
protocol there, step by atomic step, for two threads and a few units. Here
the same rules are proved for every number of threads, units and steps.

## The story, for a reader who has never seen the code

regolith reads table blocks from the disk. A thread that must never wait
(a worker in a thread-per-core pool) reads through a `CacheOnly` handle:
when the block is not in memory, the read does not touch the disk. It
records the block on the thread's own I/O queue and returns at once with
"would block". When the thread has nothing else to run, it *polls* its queue:
the poll does the disk reads its thread waits on and leaves a "you can run
again" note for every waiting read.

Tiny example. Threads A and B both miss block 7. There is one *unit* for
block 7. A's poll grabs it with one compare-and-swap (CAS), reads the block
once, and then puts one "done" note in A's inbox and one in B's. If B was
asleep, the note to B wakes B up; A is awake, so nothing wakes A.

## What is proved, in plain words

1. `claim_once`, `runs_le_one`: a unit is grabbed by one CAS, so its disk
   read runs at most once, however the threads interleave
   (TLA+ `SingleRun`).
2. `told_at_most_once`, `told_only_registered`, `every_waiter_told`: every
   queue that registered on a unit gets exactly one "done" note, and no
   other queue gets one (TLA+ `ExactlyOnce`, `EveryWaiterTold`).
3. `own_queue`: a read's request only ever sits in its own thread's inbox,
   so only that thread's poll finishes it (TLA+ `OwnQueue`).
4. `no_lost_idle_wakeup`, `busy_never_woken`: an owner asleep with nobody
   having woken it has an empty inbox, and only a sleeping owner is ever
   woken (TLA+ `NoLostIdleWakeup`, `BusyNeverWoken`).
5. `job_held`, `single_thread_finishes`: I/O regolith starts itself sits on
   the starting thread's queue, and one thread polling its own queue
   finishes every read it waits on (TLA+ `NoOrphanUnit`, `AllDone`).
6. The RED cases, as counterexamples: a claim that is a load then a store
   runs a unit twice (`load_store_claim_runs_twice`); a request sent to the
   wrong queue breaks `own_queue` (`wrong_queue_breaks_own_queue`); going
   idle in two steps loses a wakeup (`split_rest_loses_wakeup`); a poll that
   leaves the idle bit set wakes a busy owner (`stale_idle_bit_wakes_busy`);
   a job put on no queue is never run (`orphan_never_runs`).
7. The commit side (Part 5). A group of `commit_nowait` commits leaves its
   fsync as one job, a unit like any other, so 1 and 2 hold for it: one
   claim, one fsync, one note per member queue. On top of that:
   `group_sync_once`, the fsync runs at most once (TLA+ `SingleRun` on a
   group); `group_visible_after_sync`, readers see the group only after its
   fsync (TLA+ `VisibleAfterSync`); `ticket_ready_only_at_own_poll`, a
   member's ticket becomes ready only at its own queue's poll (TLA+
   `DeliveredOnOwnPoll`); `stall_lands_when_clear`, a cleared stall leaves
   no unlanded unit behind except one a writer is about to land (TLA+
   `StallLandsWhenClear`). RED: a lander that readies the members' tickets
   itself (`lander_delivery_breaks_own_poll`), and a writer that does not
   look at the stall again (`no_recheck_strands_stall`).

## How to read the Lean

`def` defines a thing, `theorem` states a fact and its proof follows
`:= by`. Lines starting with `--` are comments, in plain words. A proof is a
list of *tactics*; each one changes the goal still to be shown, and the
comment above it says how. `simp` rewrites with known facts; `omega` solves
arithmetic over natural numbers; `cases` splits on the ways a fact could be
true; `induction` proves a fact for every number of steps by proving it for
none and then for one more.

/-! ## Part 5. The commit side: a group's fsync, and a stall's unit

This part mirrors the units the commit side adds (D53). A group of commits
made by `commit_nowait` that needs an fsync is written by its leader and
left as one job (`GroupSync`, `src/engine/commit/deferred.rs`). That job
is a unit of Part 1, so Part 1 already says it is claimed by one CAS and
that every member's queue gets one "done" note. Here we follow what the
claimer does with it (sync, then apply and publish, then tell), and where
each member's ticket becomes ready: at that member's own poll.

Then the write stall (`StallSignal`, `src/engine/commit/stall.rs`). A write
a stall stops waits on a *passive* unit, which no poll runs: only the
stall's clearing lands it. A stopped writer finds or installs the unit,
registers, and only then looks at the stall again, landing the unit itself
if the stall cleared meanwhile. Tiny example of what that second look
saves: writer A sees the stall; the clearer clears it and finds no unit to
land; A installs a fresh unit. Without A's second look, nobody would ever
land it, and A's write would wait forever. -/
