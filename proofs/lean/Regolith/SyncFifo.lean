# SyncFifo: the FIFO waiter queue with handoff before wake (regolith::sync::Notify)

## The story, for a reader who has never seen the code

Think of a counter with one clerk and a line of people. A "permit" is the
clerk's attention. Whoever arrives while the clerk is busy joins the back
of the line and falls asleep. When the clerk becomes free, the permit is
put straight into the hand of the person at the front of the line, and only
then is that person woken. Nobody who arrives later can take the permit in
between, because it is never left lying on the counter while someone waits.

In the code this is the waiter queue of `Notify` (src/sync/notify.rs, on
top of `WaitQueue` in src/sync/queue.rs): a task that calls `notified()`
waits in line, and `notify_one()` hands one notification to the oldest
waiter and then wakes it.

Tiny example of what could go wrong, and does in the RED cases at the end
of this file. Request 1 holds the permit and request 2 waits. Request 1
releases. If the permit were only put back on the counter and request 2
woken, a newcomer, request 3, could grab it before request 2 gets there:
2 arrived first and is served last (`barging_breaks_fifo`). If request 2
were woken before the permit is in its hand, it could look, find nothing,
and fall asleep again, and then nobody would ever wake it
(`wake_before_handoff_strands`). If request 2 were handed the permit and
then gave up without passing it on, the permit would be gone and request 3
would wait for ever (`cancel_without_pass_on_strands`).

The theorems show that the design, where the permit is handed over first
and a waiter that gives up passes it on, has none of these problems, for
any number of permits, requests and steps.

## What this file backs

This file backs the TLA+ models of `regolith::sync` that keep FIFO
handoff in `proofs/tla`:

* `SyncNotify.tla`, invariants `FifoHandoff`, `NoLostWakeup` and
  `CancelPassesOn` (configurations `MC_SyncNotify_*`): Notify hands a
  notification to its oldest waiter before waking it;
* the waiter lists of `SyncLatch.tla` and `SyncOnce.tla`, which use the same
  registration and re-check.

Before D49 this file backed the locks too. D49 replaced FIFO handoff by
barging with a bypass bound for the lock-like primitives; their proofs are
`Regolith/Sync.lean`. Notify keeps its semantics, so the queue laws here
still back it: FIFO service, no waiter stranded beside a stored permit,
handoff before wake, and the RED cases. The model holds a fixed number of
permits, which Notify does not (notify_one creates one, notified() consumes
it), so the counting laws `permits_bounded` and `at_most_one_owner` are
about the fixed-permit queue only.

TLC checks those models step by atomic step for three tasks. Here the queue
is a sequential state machine: each step is one of the abstract actions
(fast acquire, enqueue, release, wake, poll, cancel), and a reachable state
is the result of any sequence of them, so every interleaving of the actions
is covered. The theorems hold for every number of permits, requests and
steps. The model has `n` permits and every request asks for one; Notify
is `n = 1`.

What is proved, in plain words:

1. `step_inv` and `reachable_inv`: the queue's invariant holds in every
   reachable state.
2. `permits_bounded` and `at_most_one_owner`: at most `n` requests hold a
   permit; with one permit, at most one owner exists at any time.
3. `fifo_served` and `served_in_order`: requests are served in the order
   they entered the line, and no request is ever served while one that
   entered before it still waits. Cancelled waiters are skipped.
4. `no_stranded_waiter`: while anyone waits, no permit is free; a release
   hands its permit to the oldest waiter instead of freeing it.
5. `handed_holds` and `no_lost_handoff`: a woken waiter always owns its
   permit (the handoff comes before the wake), and a waiter handed a permit
   is woken or owed a wake.
6. `position_never_grows` and `handoff_advances`: the waiters ahead of a
   waiter only ever leave, and every handoff removes one of them or serves
   it, so a waiter that is not cancelled is served after at most as many
   handoffs as there were waiters ahead of it, plus one.
7. Cancellation with pass-on is one of the steps, so all of the above hold
   with it. Three RED cases, as counterexamples:
   `barging_breaks_fifo` (a fast path that ignores the queue),
   `wake_before_handoff_strands` (waking before handing over loses the
   wake for good) and `cancel_without_pass_on_strands` (a cancelled waiter
   that keeps its permit leaves the next waiter unserved forever).

How to read the Lean: `def` defines a function or a property, `theorem`
states a fact and its proof follows `:= by`. Lines starting with `--` are
comments. `l.Sublist m` (written `<+` in some texts) says the elements of
`l` appear in `m` in the same order, possibly with others between them;
`[a, b].Sublist l` therefore says that `a` comes before `b` in `l`.
