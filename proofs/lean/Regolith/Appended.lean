# Appended: a transaction reads its own appends back, oldest first

This file backs `proofs/tla/AppendedEntries.tla`, invariants
`INV_AppendedIsCommitOrder` and `INV_RollbackRestores` (configurations
`MC_AppendedEntries_Green*`), and the RED `MC_AppendedEntries_Red_NewestFirst`.

## The story, for a reader who has never seen the code

`Transaction::append` (src/transaction/append.rs) does not write anything at
once. It puts the entry on a queue, the append buffer, and the commit later
gives the queued entries their positions in the log, in the order they were
queued. A position does not exist before that, so the transaction cannot
read its own appends from the log.

`Transaction::appended` reads the queue instead. The queue is kept newest
first (the buffer's chain walk starts at the newest), so `appended` walks it,
keeps the entries of the one log it was asked about, and reverses the result
to give oldest first.

Tiny example. The queue, newest first, is: `(log 2, "x")`, `(log 1, "b")`,
`(log 1, "a")`. Then `appended 1` is `["a", "b"]` and `appended 2` is `["x"]`.
A savepoint taken when the queue held only `(log 1, "a")` and then a
rollback gives the queue back, so `appended 1` is `["a"]` again.

What could go wrong, and what the theorems here show cannot happen, for any
number of appends and logs:

1. `appended_push_same`: an append to a log adds its entry last.
2. `appended_push_other`: an append to another log leaves the answer alone.
3. `rollback_restores`: a rollback to a savepoint gives the queue the
   savepoint saw, so `appended` returns what it returned then
   (`appended_after_rollback`).
4. `appended_is_commit_order`: the answer is the entries of the log among the
   queue taken in the order the commit numbers them, so entry number `i` of
   the answer is the one that takes the `i`-th of this transaction's
   positions in the log.
5. `newest_first_breaks_order`: a RED as a concrete counterexample. Without
   the reversal the answer is newest first and differs from commit order.

How to read the Lean: `def` defines a function, `theorem` states a fact and
its proof follows `:= by`. Lines starting with `--` are comments. A log and an
entry are plain natural numbers.
