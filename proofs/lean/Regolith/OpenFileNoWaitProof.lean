# OpenFileNoWaitProof: every step keeps the facts, so no parked unit is lost

The second half of `Regolith/OpenFileNoWait.lean` (decision D60), which
defines the steps, the facts `Inv` and the lemmas used here. This file proves
that every step of the real code keeps every fact (`inv_step`), so every
reachable state has them (`inv_reach`), and from them the rule TLA+ calls
`RetryNeverLost` (`retry_never_lost`): a parked unit already has its "slot
freed" message, or its queue is on the parked list and some slot is WANTED
and busy, or a reader that freed a WANTED slot is on its way to waking the
list. It holds for every number of slots and threads.

Each step gets its own case below: the steps that touch nothing the facts
are about go through `inv_frame`; the others are checked fact by fact.
