/-!
A commit may replace two adjacent operands with the caller's exact partial
merge. For example, [+1, +1] becomes [+2]. It must not reorder operands,
invent an answer when the caller declines, or rewrite an older commit.
These proofs cover every base and every surrounding operand sequence.
Publication and snapshot registration remain the existing pipeline's job.
