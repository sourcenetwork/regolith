# OpenFileNoWaitRed: each planted bug breaks the rule it is planted against

The RED half of `Regolith/OpenFileNoWait.lean` (decision D60). Each theorem
here is a counterexample: a run of the steps of one buggy variant, with one
slot, thread 1 a Blocking read and thread 2 a queue unit, that ends in a
state the rule forbids. They mirror the RED configurations of
`proofs/tla/OpenFileTable.tla`:

- `waits_waits` (`MC_OpenFileTable_Red_Waits`): a unit that waits for a slot
  like a Blocking read has, at some point, no step of its own;
- `mark_first_loses_retry` (`MC_OpenFileTable_Red_MarkFirst`): a park that
  marks before it joins the list is never woken;
- `publish_drops_loses_retry` (`MC_OpenFileTable_Red_PublishDropsWanted`): a
  publish that drops the mark leaves a parked unit nobody will wake;
- `wake_needs_parked_loses_retry` (`MC_OpenFileTable_Red_WakeNeedsParked`): a
  wake that tells only parked units skips one about to park.

Each proof builds the run one step at a time (`have rN := Reach.step ...`,
each step's conditions checked by `simp` or `decide`), then shows the final
state breaks the rule.

at `claim` until thread 1 moves, which is waiting on another thread. -/
