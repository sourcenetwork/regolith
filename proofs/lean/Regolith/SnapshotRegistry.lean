# SnapshotRegistry: per-thread slots, counted entries, announce, sample, confirm

THE STORY. A database keeps old versions of a key while a reader still
needs them. A reader takes a snapshot: it writes down the newest commit
number it may see (the horizon) and reads only versions at or below it. A
compaction throws away versions nobody can see, so it must find every live
snapshot. Tiny example of the danger: the horizon is 0, reader A reads 0, a
commit makes the horizon 1, a compaction finds no snapshot and deletes the
version at 0, then A registers at 0 and reads a version that is gone.

THE CODE (`src/engine/snapshot_registry.rs`, `chain.rs`). No lock. Every
thread number owns a slot; a slot has entries; an entry holds one sequence
and a count of the pins on it. A reader announces the horizon `v` it read in
an entry of its slot (a new entry, or one more count on an entry that holds
`v`), then a fence, then reads the horizon again: still `v` means live at
`v`, otherwise it takes its count back and tries the new value. A copy of a
snapshot adds one count to the original's entry. A release takes one count
off the entry its pin recorded, whatever thread drops it. A compaction
fences (its sample), then reads every entry.

WHAT IS PROVED HERE, for every interleaving, by naming the moment of each
access (a moment is a natural number; the horizon at moment `t` is `H t`
and only rises):

1. `held_keeps_seq`: an entry's sequence does not change while some pin
   holds it.
2. `scan_respects_live`: a scan's minimum is at most a live snapshot, and
   the snapshot is either in what the scan read or at or above the sampled
   horizon. Backs `MinBelowLive` and `LiveCovered` in
   `proofs/tla/SnapshotRegistry.tla`.
3. `clone_respects_live`: the same for a copy that joined the original's
   entry, from the moment the original was announced.
4. `pins_exact`: an entry's count always equals the live pins recorded at
   it, whichever thread released each one. Backs `PinsExact`.
5. The RED cases as counterexamples: `no_confirm_breaks_min`,
   `fresh_clone_breaks_cover`, `release_elsewhere_breaks_count`.

Memory ordering is sequentially consistent here: each access happens at one
moment. The real accesses get that from two SeqCst fences, which loom checks
(`tests/loom_snapshots.rs`).
