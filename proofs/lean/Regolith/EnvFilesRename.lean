# EnvFilesRename: a reopen always finds a table that is being renamed aside

This file extends `Regolith/EnvFiles.lean` with Part 3 of the TLA+ model
`proofs/tla/EnvFiles.tla` (`OpenFindsFile`). TLC checks it for two reopens;
here it is proved for any number of reopens and every order of steps.

## The story, for a reader who has never seen the code

Under `max_open_files` a table's file is closed while nobody reads it, and
reopened by name (`PathEntry::reopen`, `src/env/open_file_limit/mod.rs`). A
compaction that removes a table a reader still holds moves the file aside
instead (`Shared::relocate`), in four steps, each one atomic:

1. record both names: the new one, "B", as current, the old one, "A", as
   "previous";
2. the Env's rename puts the file under "B" (one map write);
3. the Env's rename takes the file away from "A" (a second map write);
4. record only "B".

A reopen loads the recorded names, tries "previous" (if any), then
"current". If neither holds the file, it loads the names again: if the move
recorded new ones since, it tries those; if not, the file is really gone.

Tiny example. Thread 1 loads the names: just "A". Thread 2 runs the whole
move. Thread 1 opens "A": nothing. It loads the names again, finds "B",
and opens it.

## What is proved, in plain words

1. `open_finds_file`: in the real code, no reopen ever ends with nothing.
2. The RED cases, as counterexamples: a rename that takes "A" away before
   it puts the file at "B" loses a reopen (`remove_first_loses`, what
   `MemEnv::rename` did before the fix); a reopen that does not load the
   names again loses one too (`no_reload_loses`, what `PathEntry::reopen`
   did before the fix).

## How to read the Lean

`def` defines a thing, `theorem` states a fact and its proof follows
`:= by`. Lines starting with `--` are comments, in plain words. A proof is a
list of *tactics*; each one changes the goal still to be shown, and the
comment above it says how. `simp` rewrites with known facts; `omega` solves
arithmetic over natural numbers; `cases` splits on the ways a fact could be
true; `induction` proves a fact for every number of steps by proving it for
none and then for one more.
