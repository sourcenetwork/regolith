# OpenFileNoWait: a queue unit never waits for a slot, and is never forgotten

This file extends `Regolith/OpenFileTable.lean` with decision D60, and backs
the second story of the TLA+ model `proofs/tla/OpenFileTable.tla`
(`NeverWaits` and `RetryNeverLost`). TLC checks them for one or two slots and
two or three threads; here they are proved for every number of slots,
threads and steps.

## The story, for a reader who has never seen the code

Under `max_open_files`, every open table file lives in one of `cap` slots
(`SlotTable`, `src/env/open_file_limit/slots.rs`). Some reads promise never
to wait for another thread: a `CacheOnly` read's device work runs later as a
*unit* on its thread's own I/O queue (`src/engine/io`). When that unit must
reopen its table while every slot is busy with other threads' reads, it may
not wait for a slot (a `Blocking` read may). It *parks* instead:

1. it puts its queue on the table's parked list (`register`);
2. it looks at each slot again: one that freed it claims, each busy one it
   marks WANTED (`mark`);
3. the unit is parked and the poll returns (`park`).

The read that frees a WANTED slot clears the mark and tells every queue on
the list "a slot freed" (`clearW`, `wake`). The message waits in the queue's
inbox, and the queue's next poll unparks the unit and runs it again (`poll`).

Tiny example. One slot. Thread 1 (Blocking) reads table A in it. Thread 2's
unit wants table B: it joins the list, marks the slot, parks. Thread 1
leaves: the slot is free and WANTED, so thread 1 clears the mark and tells
thread 2. Thread 2 polls and runs its unit again, which now claims the slot.

## What is proved, in plain words

1. `never_waits` (here): a queue unit that is in the middle of its read
   always has a step of its own to take, whatever every other thread is
   doing (TLA+ `NeverWaits`).
2. `retry_never_lost` (`Regolith/OpenFileNoWaitProof.lean`, from the facts
   `Inv` and the lemmas here): a parked unit already has its message, or
   will get one: its queue is on the list and some slot is WANTED and busy,
   or a reader that freed a WANTED slot is on its way to waking the list
   (TLA+ `RetryNeverLost`).
3. The RED cases, as counterexamples (`Regolith/OpenFileNoWaitRed.lean`): a
   unit that waits for a slot like a Blocking read (`waits_waits`); a park
   that marks before it joins the list (`mark_first_loses_retry`); a publish
   that drops the mark (`publish_drops_loses_retry`); a wake that tells only
   units already parked (`wake_needs_parked_loses_retry`).

## What is left out, and why

Which table a slot holds, its file, and the owner check of a join are what
`OpenFileTable.lean` proves things about; whether a unit is woken depends
only on whether slots are busy, so here a slot is its phase, its reader
count and its WANTED bit. A join is one step (the owner check's failures
only send a thread back to its start). Memory ordering is the loom models'
job (`tests/loom_tables.rs`).

## How to read the Lean

`def` defines a thing, `theorem` states a fact and its proof follows
`:= by`. Lines starting with `--` are comments, in plain words. A proof is a
list of *tactics*; each one changes the goal still to be shown, and the
comment above it says how. `simp` rewrites with known facts; `omega` solves
arithmetic over natural numbers; `cases` splits on the ways a fact could be
true; `induction` proves a fact for every number of steps by proving it for
none and then for one more.
