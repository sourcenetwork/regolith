# ManifestRecovery: a torn manifest end (E29) and the logs a flush retires (E30)

This file backs the TLA+ model `proofs/tla/ManifestRecovery.tla`
(configurations `MC_ManifestRecovery_*`): `crash_never_proves` is its
`RecoveryOpens`, `replay_is_prefix` and `replay_keeps_synced` are the
manifest half of `AckedSurvive`, and `replay_never_above_newer_table` with
`memtable_newest_is_newest` is `ReadsNewest`. The model checks a few runs
step by step; this file proves the same laws for every size.

## The story, with a tiny example

The MANIFEST is regolith's list of the table files that make up the
database: a run of batches written one after another. A batch that adds a
table is synced (the writer waits until it is on the disk) before the next
batch is written. A batch that only reserves a file number is not.

Example: a new database writes `a = 1`, then flushes it. The flush appends
"reserve 2", "reserve 3", then "table 3 is in", and syncs. If the power goes
out during that sync, the last three batches can come back as garbage. That
is a crash's doing, and the write-ahead log still holds `a = 1`.

E29: the open used to refuse such a database. The fix refuses only when a
whole batch that needed a sync sits after the damage with more bytes after
it: those bytes were written after that sync finished, and the sync made
the damaged spot durable, so a crash cannot have damaged it.

E30: after a flush the engine deletes the log the table covers. If the
delete failed, the next open replayed that log into memory, which is read
before any table, so an old value came back over a newer table. The fix
records `min_wal_id` in the table's own batch, and recovery skips every log
below it.

## What is proved, in plain words

1. `crash_never_proves`: when the writer syncs every batch that needs it
   before writing on, no damage a crash leaves is ever "proved synced", so
   the open accepts every crash state.
2. `replay_is_prefix` and `replay_keeps_synced`: what replay keeps is exactly
   the batches the writer wrote, in order, and at least every synced one.
3. `replay_never_above_newer_table`: with `min_wal_id` in the table's batch,
   every version recovery puts in memory is newer than every version any
   table holds of the same key; `memtable_newest_is_newest` turns that into
   "reading memory first returns the newest version".
4. `no_sync_before_next_refuses_a_crash` and `stale_without_min_wal`: the two
   RED cases as concrete counterexamples.
5. `crash_never_proves_opened`: on a sealed manifest the judge opens each
   batch before it reads whether the writer synced it, and then accepts every
   crash state; `judging_ciphertext_refuses_a_crash` is the RED where it reads
   the sealed bytes as plain records (`MC_ManifestRecovery_Red_JudgeCiphertext`).
6. `oldest_first_keeps_every_log`: with several memtables waiting and flushes
   on several threads, every flush takes the oldest, so every version of every
   log comes back from a table or replayed; `newest_first_loses_a_log` is the
   RED where a newer memtable is flushed first
   (`MC_ManifestRecovery_Red_NewestFirst`).

The code each definition mirrors is named on it. The engine side lives in
`src/engine/manifest/tail.rs` (the judgment), `src/engine/manifest.rs`
(`VersionSet::apply`, `judge_end`) and `src/engine/log_retirement.rs`.

removes a table, false for one that only reserves a number). -/
