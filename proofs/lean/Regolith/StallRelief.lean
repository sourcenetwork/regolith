# StallRelief: no stopped writer waits on a relief nobody runs

This file backs the TLA+ model `proofs/tla/StallRelief.tla`. TLC checks
two writers there; here the rules are proved for any number of writers.

## The story, for a reader who has never seen the code

A write "stop" refuses writes until the background makes room. With no
background worker, a stopped writer makes room itself, with flush and
compaction steps, and for each step it needs the "gate". If another thread
holds the gate, the writer does not wait for the gate: it waits on the
stall's unit, trusting the gate's holder.

Three kinds of thread hold the gate: a stopped writer relieving the stop;
a writer whose write left one step owing, which it runs once and returns;
and a foreground job (an ingest, a checkpoint), which holds it for its
whole run.

Tiny example: writer 1 holds the gate for one step, writer 2 finds it held
and waits, writer 1's step leaves the stop on and writer 1 returns. If the
unit landed only when the stop cleared, writer 2 would wait for ever. So
every piece of progress lands the unit, stop or no stop ("relief handed
back"), and each waiter looks again. A writer that found the gate held but
registers only after such a landing would miss it, so it reads a progress
count before its step and again once registered, and lands its own unit if
the count moved. A job that held the gate relieves the stop once it
releases the gate.

Two more stories (E35). The engine "latches" when its log is left in a
state nobody can vouch for: every write fails from then on, so no stop is
relieved any more. A writer waiting on the unit would wait until the
database closes, so the latch lands the unit, and the writer, writing
again, is told the latch. The latch stores its flag before it lands the
unit, and a writer reads the flag again once registered, so a writer that
registers after the landing is told too. And a writer let in with no stop
may have to flush at the memtable cap, under the gate, before it seals: its
flush changes what the stop counts, so it counts its progress on every way
out, whether its seal went through or failed.

## What is proved, in plain words

1. `no_stranded_wait`: in every state the real code reaches, once every
   writer has finished or waits, and the job is not running or still to
   relieve, nobody waits (TLA+ `NoStrandedWait`).
2. `no_wait_once_latched`: in every state the real code reaches, once the
   engine latched and its landing is done, nobody waits (TLA+
   `NoWaitOnceLatched`).
3. The RED cases, each a run of the buggy steps that ends with a writer
   waiting and nobody left to land its unit:
   `no_relief_strands_a_waiter` (the job ends with no relief),
   `no_hand_back_strands_a_waiter` (progress lands the unit only when the
   stop cleared), `no_recheck_strands_a_waiter` (a contended writer
   registers without reading the count again),
   `no_rotate_refresh_strands_a_waiter` (a rotation whose seal fails counts
   no progress); and two that end with a writer waiting on a latched
   engine: `no_latch_land_strands_a_waiter` (the latch lands nothing) and
   `no_latch_recheck_strands_a_waiter` (a writer registers without reading
   the latch's flag again).

## How the writers are counted

Writers are counted by what they are doing, not named. A contended writer
is "fresh" while no progress was counted since it read the count, and
"stale" once some was: that is all the count's value is used for. A writer
whose step holds the gate is counted the same whether the step relieves a
stop, is the one a write owed, or is a rotation's flush.

## Where the steps here allow more than the model

On a latched engine the model has every write told the latch. Here a
writer may be told and finish (`told`, `owedLatched`), or go on as if
nothing had latched; only its registering is held to the latch's flag.
Every run of the model is a run of these steps, so what is proved of these
holds for the model.

## How to read the Lean

`def` defines a thing, `theorem` states a fact and its proof follows
`:= by`. Lines starting with `--` are comments, in plain words. A proof is a
list of *tactics*; each one changes the goal still to be shown, and the
comment above it says how. `simp` rewrites with known facts; `omega` solves
arithmetic over natural numbers; `cases` splits on the ways a fact could be
true; `induction` proves a fact for every number of steps.
