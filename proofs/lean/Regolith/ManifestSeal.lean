# ManifestSeal: a sealed manifest keeps its checksum (plan 4.12, D45)

The story. The MANIFEST is the log of version edits: which tables exist,
the last sequence, the next file id. On an encrypted database each edit
batch is sealed with AES-256-GCM-SIV under the key the provider names
current, and names that key (`src/engine/manifest/sealed.rs`). Picture two
batches: the first synced, the second in the page cache when the power
goes. The second comes back with its length but zeros for its bytes. The
reopen must drop it and open with the first. But a batch sealed under a key
the provider lacks, or opened under a wrong key, also fails its tag. If the
tag were the only check, nothing could tell the two apart: drop both, and a
wrong key opens a database with no tables; refuse both, and a plain power
cut leaves a database nobody can open.

The engine keeps the checksum, which needs no key, and checks it first
(`VersionSet::replay_manifest`): a batch whose checksum fails is torn and
ends the replay; a batch whose checksum holds is opened under the key it
names, and a missing key or a failed tag refuses.

This file backs `proofs/tla/ManifestSeal.tla` (configurations
`MC_ManifestSeal_*`). What is proved, for manifests of every length:

1. `replay_opens_with_right_keys`: with the right keys, the replay of any
   crash that kept the synced batches opens and keeps them all
   (`RecoveryOpens`, `KeepsSynced`).
2. `open_ends_only_at_a_torn_batch`: when the replay opens and stops
   before the last batch, the batch it stopped at was torn: a whole batch
   it could not read never ends it (`OnlyTornEnds`).
3. `wrong_key_refuses` and `missing_key_refuses`: a whole batch under a
   wrong or missing key refuses the open.
4. The RED cases as counterexamples: `tag_only_stop_opens_under_a_wrong_key`
   and `tag_only_refuse_refuses_a_power_cut`.
