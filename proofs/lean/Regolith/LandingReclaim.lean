/- A queue's landed block is named by the owner's ledger (Ledger::order,
   src/io_queue/ledger.rs) and by two kovan maps: the landing table
   (QueueShared::landed, src/engine/io/shared.rs) and the unit table
   (IoRuntime::units, src/engine/io/mod.rs). A key removed from a kovan map
   leaves a retired node that kovan frees only on a later step of the thread
   that retired it, a step an idle thread never takes.
   A tiny example: the ledger drops a 44 KiB block and its thread idles. If a
   retired node owns a strong handle, the block lives as long as the idle.
   What must never happen: a block the ledger let go and no reader holds stays
   alive through a map. The laws below hold for every reclamation schedule:
   with weak handles in the maps (Posted::Ready, Weak<Unit>) the block's strong
   count after release is zero; with a strong handle it stays one for any
   number of idle polls. LandingReclaim.tla checks the interleavings. -/
