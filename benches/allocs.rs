//! Allocation budgets for regolith's hot paths, enforced as a gate.
//!
//! Run with `cargo bench --bench allocs`. The process exits non-zero as
//! soon as any path allocates more per operation than its budget, so
//! this binary sits in CI next to the test suite.
//!
//! Counting is gated two ways at once. A process-wide atomic switches
//! the allocator hook on only for the measured region, so opening a
//! database, filling it and tearing it down are never attributed to a
//! path. The counters themselves are thread-local, so background
//! compaction, which runs on its own thread, is excluded even when it
//! overlaps the measured region. A memtable flush is not background
//! work: `rotate_if_full` runs on the group leader's own thread, so a
//! flush inside a measured region is counted. The gated `put` rows use
//! the default 64 MiB write buffer and never rotate; `rotation_disclosure`
//! measures a configuration that does.
//!
//! Every path is measured twice, because subtracting a harness cost is
//! only as honest as the control that estimates it. The `sub` run builds
//! its keys with `format!` inside the measured loop, matching the shape
//! of the recorded `d1ec2e7` baseline, and a control loop that builds
//! the same keys and does nothing else is subtracted from it. The `pre`
//! run builds the keys before the region opens, so it needs no
//! subtraction and no control can flatter it. The gate uses whichever of
//! the two is larger.
