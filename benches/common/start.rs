//! A common start for benches that time several threads at once.
//!
//! The clock must start before any timed operation can run. A single
//! barrier that the coordinator leaves and then reads the clock after does
//! not hold that: the workers leave the same barrier and start working while
//! the coordinator may still be descheduled, so their first operations land
//! before the window opens and the time per operation reads low. Here the
//! workers wait at two barriers: the first says every worker is ready, the
//! clock is read, and only then does the second let them go, so every timed
//! operation is inside the window.
