test-fault:

# The `#[ignore]`d fault tests: each spawns child processes and simulates a

# default run so `cargo test` stays quick.

test-fault-slow:
    cargo nextest run --test fault_smoke

# The `#[ignore]`d resource-exhaustion and extremes tests: six-figure key
# counts, a 64 MiB value, megabyte keys, a six-level cascade, and a real
# ENOSPC on a tmpfs mounted in a private user namespace. About 21 s in
# total on a debug build. `--test-threads=1` is required, not cosmetic:
# each test resets the kernel's peak-RSS counter to report its own memory
# high-water mark, and a concurrent test would inflate that number.

test-crash:
    cargo test --test crash_recovery

# Handle lifecycle: open, close, reopen under changed Options, locking,
# and every misuse of a closed or read-only handle. Measured at 0.4s, so
# every test in the file also runs in the default `cargo test`; nothing
# here is `#[ignore]`d.

test-power:
    cargo test --test power_loss -- --skip crash_child --nocapture

# Process-crash recovery: kill -9 at every point in the write path. Every
# test in the file is in the default run already; this recipe just runs the
# file on its own. Measured at 0.6s, spawning 41 child processes.

test-corruption-slow:
    cargo nextest run --test corruption_exhaustive

# The power-loss durability tests, with output shown so the measured cost of
# the default DurabilityMode::Eventual is visible. Every test here spawns a
# child process, crashes it at a byte-exact point and simulates a power cut.
# Measured at 0.6s in total, so it also runs in the default `cargo test`.

test-durability-slow:
    cargo nextest run --test proptest_durability

# Every ignored test in the workspace, including the scheduled stress runs.

test-extremes:
    cargo nextest run --test resource_limits --no-capture --test-threads 1

# The `#[ignore]`d durability property test: 128 randomized operation
# sequences, each run in a child process that is killed part way through
# and then power-cut by discarding every byte it never fsynced. Measured
# at 1.1 s. Needs the LD_PRELOAD fault shim, so it is Linux only.

test-lifecycle:
    cargo test --test lifecycle -- --skip crash_child

# MVCC and concurrency invariants: snapshot stability under concurrent
# writers and compaction, WriteBatch atomicity seen by concurrent readers,
# monotonic reads, version integrity across delete/compact/reopen, and
# iterators pinned across compactions that unlink their files. Measured at
# 0.5s, so every test in the fast set also runs in the default `cargo test`.

# trials, measured at 1.2s of wall time.

mvcc:
    cargo test --test mvcc_invariants -- --skip crash_child

# The `#[ignore]`d full-scale MVCC soaks: 120,000 writes racing a snapshot
# that pins every version of them, 30,000 WriteBatch generations checked by
# four readers, 1.9M monotonic point reads, and the focused gate for the
# user-thread `compact_range` read race. Measured at 13.8s + 9.3s + 4.5s +
# 26s on a debug build.
#
# This recipe is RED today, and that is the point: the focused gate finds a
# real read-path defect. See the doc comment on
# `a_user_thread_compact_range_never_makes_a_read_travel_backwards`.

# ---------- model checking ----------

# Loom model checks for the arena memtable, read horizon and version
# handoffs. `--cfg loom` swaps the primitives in `src/engine/sync.rs`
# for loom's instrumented ones; without it the whole target compiles
# away, so an ordinary `cargo test` neither builds loom nor runs these.
#
# | recipe        | models | profile | measured |
# |---------------|--------|---------|----------|
# | `loom`        | 16     | release | 21.6s    |
# | `loom-debug`  | 17     | debug   | 16.0s    |
# | `loom-all`    | both   | both    | ~38s     |
#
# Re-measured on a host at load average 105-140 on 36 threads (a shared,
# heavily loaded machine), so these are not comparable to a quiet-host
# baseline; they are the wall time `cargo test`'s own summary line
# reported for the test binary, excluding compilation.
#
# The debug run carries one extra calibration: the skip list's
# single-writer guard (S2) is a `debug_assert`, so the model proving it
# fires is compiled out of a release build. The arena's single-writer
# guard (A8) is debug-only the same way, but its own calibration runs in
# both profiles with a different expected panic message per profile (a
# debug build trips the guard, a release build trips loom's tracked
# cell), so it does not add to the debug-only gap the way S2's does.
# Seven of the models are `should_panic` calibrations that deliberately
# get the ordering wrong; they are what make the passes mean anything.

# The read-view chaos workload at full size: 6 instances x 2 rounds x 400

# which is why `cargo test` runs a smaller default and this recipe
# carries the full one. Release, because debug is where the cost is.
#
# Sized to finish, not to be maximal. Cost is roughly
# instances x rounds x versions x compaction passes, and the compaction
# passes each rewrite a database that grows with the version count, so
# raising `versions` raises the run time faster than linearly: 400 does
# not complete inside seven minutes, 120 completes in seconds. What the
# workload is hunting is overlap between a compaction and a read, and
# the overlap count is already in the thousands per instance here.
