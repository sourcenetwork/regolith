//! Process-crash recovery: `kill -9` at every meaningful point in the
//! write path.
//!
//! # Why this file is separate from the power-loss tests
//!
//! A process kill and a power cut are different failures and prove
//! different things. When a process is killed, every byte it handed to the
//! kernel is still in the page cache and the kernel goes on to write it
//! out; nothing is lost that the process had not already lost. A power cut
//! additionally discards everything that was never `fsync`ed. This file is
//! only about the first failure, which makes its bar the strict one:
//!
//! **a process kill must lose nothing that reached the kernel.**
//!
//! regolith hands every WAL record to the kernel before the write is
//! acknowledged, in both durability modes: `Immediate` calls `Wal::sync`
//! and `Eventual` calls `Wal::flush`, which empties the `BufWriter` with a
//! real `write` syscall (`src/engine/mod.rs:1389`). So under a process
//! kill, and unlike under a power cut, "every acknowledged write survives"
//! is the correct expectation even in the default `Eventual` mode, and
//! that is what these tests assert. A test here that tolerated losing an
//! acknowledged write would be measuring nothing.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Every kill point is byte-exact: either the workload killing itself once
//! a chosen write has returned `Ok`, or the `LD_PRELOAD` shim raising
//! `SIGKILL` on the nth matching syscall. There is no wall clock and no
//! sleep in any kill path, so a fast machine and a slow one crash at the
//! same byte. Where a background thread makes a count non-deterministic (a
//! flush or a compaction racing the foreground writer), the test asserts
//! the invariant and never the count.
//!
//! # Runtime
//!
//! Every test here is in the default run: the whole file spawns 41 child
//! processes and is measured at 0.6s with the default test parallelism
//! (0.9s serial). The only non-test function
//! is `crash_child`, which is the child entry point and not a test. Run
//! the file on its own with `just test-crash`.

//! # Linux only
//!
//! Every test here re-executes a child under the `LD_PRELOAD` fault
//! shim so the harness can record which bytes actually reached the
//! kernel. `LD_PRELOAD` interposition is a glibc mechanism, so on any
//! other target the shim cannot be built and the child cannot be
//! observed. The file is compiled out there rather than failing at
//! run time: a test that panics because the platform cannot host its
//! mechanism reports a defect that does not exist.
