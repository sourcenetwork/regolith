//! Loom models of the lock-free commit pipeline (plan 4.7) and of the step
//! the version store's sections run in.
//!
//! ```text
//! RUSTFLAGS="--cfg loom" cargo test --release --test loom_pipeline
//! ```
//!
//! The models live in `src/engine/commit/loom_model.rs`,
//! `src/engine/commit/loom_write_unit.rs`,
//! `src/engine/commit/loom_turn_wait.rs`,
//! `src/engine/loom_model/step.rs` and `src/engine/loom_model/park.rs`,
//! next to the crate-private types they drive. What each proves:
//!
//! - **Reserve and void**: an owner installs the index it reserved while a
//!   helper voids it; exactly one wins, and the descriptor is dropped once.
//! - **A cell's next lap**: a slot is retired while the index one lap later
//!   is installed into its cell; the new descriptor is never taken for the
//!   old one.
//! - **The pin**: a descriptor, or the pipeline's state, loaded while it is
//!   retired or replaced is alive, and one loaded while it is installed is
//!   the one installed.
//! - **The drop at the swap**: a replaced tip is dropped at once when no
//!   load is counted in, and waits on the list otherwise; no value is
//!   dropped while loaded or dropped twice.
//! - **Decide with helping**: two threads decide the same two slots at
//!   once; each slot gets one decision and the sequences are dense.
//! - **The watermark claim**: two commits need the log durable; one claims
//!   the round and syncs, the other parks and is woken, and no two syncs
//!   overlap.
//! - **Publish**: two helpers publish one slot; whoever sees it published
//!   finds the read horizon at its sequence.
//! - **A rollback meeting a decision under way**: the decision computed
//!   from the discarded state never becomes the pipeline's state.
//! - **The version step**: two sections handed over at once never overlap,
//!   both run, and a caller parked on its section is woken.
//! - **Parking** (a queue's poll never waits for another thread): a thread
//!   blocked on a job its holder parks runs it; a job parked for the step
//!   is woken when the step is given up; a rollback parked for a write in
//!   flight cuts the log only after the write left; a sync parked for a
//!   copy of a record in flight begins only after the copy left, and a copy
//!   counted in after the sync turned the gate writes nothing; and a queue
//!   the wake of a parked job had off the list when the job landed is told
//!   once.
//!
//! - **The write unit** (E45, L58): one thread at a time holds the unit; a
//!   writer parked on its record is woken when the holder's run writes it,
//!   and when the holder lets the unit go with the record still waiting; a
//!   run looks at its record again once counted in at the gate, so it never
//!   lands under a sync; a `commit_nowait` commit left on its queue is
//!   told when the unit is let go; one thread at a time encodes a record,
//!   the owner or a thread that needs it; and a writer parked on a record
//!   being encoded is woken when it is filled.
//! - **A call far from its turn** (E45 step 2, `turn_wait.rs`): a blocking
//!   call parked on its own slot is named by the pass that brings its turn
//!   near and told by the next finished commit, and is woken when its slot
//!   lands, whoever published it.
//!
//! Every model is bounded by a small scenario (a ring of two cells, two
//! threads or two and a reader) and an explicit preemption bound given in
//! the model's own code, never by a time limit. Each is paired with a
//! calibration that writes one step the wrong way and must fail; without
//! them a search that never reached the bad interleaving would pass for the
//! same reason a broken one does.
