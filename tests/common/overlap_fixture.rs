//! `tests/fixtures/v0_1_9_overlap`: a database the release tagged `v0.1.9`
//! left with two tables of overlapping key ranges in its bottom level, and
//! what its newest versions are.
//!
//! It was written by that release, not by this version and not by hand,
//! because the defect is in what that release wrote: it placed an ingested
//! table by the range of its keys and recorded it with the wider range of
//! its range tombstone. Under `Immediate` durability and a concatenating
//! merge operator named `concat`, with every put's value `"<tag>:"`
//! followed by 200 bytes derived from the tag ([`value`]):
//!
//! 1. `put c d e f h i j = old`, `merge a1 x`, `merge j2 1`, `flush`,
//!    `compact_range(None, None)`: one table in level 6;
//! 2. `put b k = old`, `flush`: one table in level 0. Then
//!    `ingest_external_files` of a table another 0.1.9 database flushed
//!    after `put m n p = ingested` and `delete_range [a, g)`. Its keys
//!    `m..p` meet no table, so 0.1.9 put it in level 6, recorded as `a..p`:
//!    it overlaps the table of step 1 there, and its range tombstone is
//!    newer than `b` in level 0;
//! 3. reopened with a 512 byte level 1 budget and a worker: `put d h n =
//!    new`, `delete p`, `merge a1 y`, `merge j2 2`, `flush`. The worker
//!    compacted level 0 to level 1 and on to level 2;
//! 4. reopened with the default budget: `put h = newer`, `put i = new`,
//!    `flush`, `put j m = new`, `merge j2 3`, `flush`. The worker compacted
//!    level 0 to level 1;
//! 5. reopened with no worker: `put f i = l0`, `flush`; then `put e = wal`,
//!    `delete k`, `put q = wal`, `merge j2 4`, and the process exited
//!    without closing, so those four writes are only in the format 1 log.
//!
//! That leaves one table in level 0, one in level 1, one in level 2 and two
//! in level 6. 0.1.9 itself answered `get(b) = old`, from the level it read
//! before the range tombstone's, and failed every scan with "SSTable
//! iteration went backwards".
