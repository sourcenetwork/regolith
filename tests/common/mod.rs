//! Shared helpers for regolith integration tests.
//!
//! Each file under `tests/` is compiled as its own integration-test
//! crate, so Rust has no inherent way to share code between them. The
//! idiomatic workaround is a `common/mod.rs` subdirectory: it is
//! *not* treated as a standalone test binary, but any test file can
//! pull it in with `mod common;`.
//!
//! Keep this module small and opinionated - helpers here get
//! recompiled once per test binary, so bloat costs compile time.
