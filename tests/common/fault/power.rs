//! Power-loss reconstruction from a recorded syscall stream.
//!
//! # Why this is not `kill -9`
//!
//! Killing a process leaves every byte it wrote sitting in the OS page
//! cache, and the kernel goes on to write those bytes to disk. A `kill -9`
//! test therefore proves that the engine survives losing its *memory*, not
//! that it survives losing its *unsynced disk writes*. A suite that stops
//! at `kill -9` and calls durability proven is a false green.
//!
//! A power cut discards everything that was not `fsync`ed. This module
//! reproduces that: it replays the journal recorded by the `LD_PRELOAD`
//! shim, works out which byte ranges were written but never followed by a
//! successful `fsync`/`fdatasync` on that file, and rewrites the directory
//! as the filesystem would have left it. This is the ALICE model, driven
//! by the syscalls regolith actually issued rather than by an assumption about
//! what regolith issues.
//!
//! # What is modelled
//!
//! * Unsynced byte ranges, dropped or torn per [`TearMode`].
//! * Reordering headroom: a cut can be placed at any journal sequence
//!   number, not only at the end of the run.
//! * Optionally, files created but never made durable by an `fsync` of
//!   their parent directory ([`PowerLossOptions::drop_unsynced_creates`]).
//! * Renames before the cut: the file keeps its bytes and what was synced
//!   of them under its new name, which counts as created at the rename for
//!   the option above.
//!
//! # What is NOT modelled, stated so nobody assumes otherwise
//!
//! * Resurrection of an `unlink`ed file whose directory was never synced.
//!   Undoing an unlink needs the file's contents, which the journal does
//!   not carry. Not resurrecting is the *milder* outcome, so a passing
//!   test here is weaker than reality on that one axis.
//! * Cross-file write reordering below the granularity of a single
//!   `write` call. A partial write is torn at [`PowerLossOptions::
//!   sector_bytes`] granularity, not at arbitrary byte granularity.
//! * Barriers and disk-cache behaviour of a specific device.
//! * A rename after the cut point. The file under its new name is cut back
//!   like any file first touched after the cut, and its old name is not
//!   restored, for the same reason an unlink is not undone.
