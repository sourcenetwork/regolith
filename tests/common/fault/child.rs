//! Subprocess crash harness.
//!
//! A crash test needs a real process that really dies, so the workload runs
//! in a child. The child is the test binary re-executing itself: a separate
//! `bin` target would not see the test crate's code, so instead the parent
//! spawns `current_exe()` with `--exact <entry test>` and an
//! environment describing the workload. The entry test returns immediately
//! when that environment is absent, so a normal `cargo test` run never
//! notices it.
//!
//! Every test file that uses this harness declares the entry point once:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! mod common;
//!
//! #[test]
//! //! fn crash_child() {
//!     common::fault::child_entrypoint(common::fault::builtin_workload);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Kill points
//!
//! Wall-clock kills are not reproducible and land nowhere in particular.
//! These land on a semantic boundary instead. [`Phase::AfterNPuts`] is the
//! workload killing itself once a chosen write has returned `Ok`. Every
//! other phase is byte-exact: the `LD_PRELOAD` shim counts the matching
//! `write`/`fsync` calls and raises `SIGKILL` on the nth one, so the crash
//! lands at the same byte on a fast machine and a slow one.
