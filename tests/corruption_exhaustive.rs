//! Exhaustive on-disk corruption: truncation at every offset, bit rot in
//! every region, torn record headers, and structurally impossible table
//! sets.
//!
//! `tests/corruption.rs` and `tests/open_and_corruption.rs` already poke a
//! handful of hand-picked offsets. This file differs from them in two
//! ways that matter.
//!
//! **Coverage.** Every byte offset of the WAL, of an SSTable and of the
//! MANIFEST is truncated, and every bit of every byte is flipped, by the
//! exhaustive sweeps. The default run takes a seeded, evenly spread
//! sample of the same offsets so `cargo test` stays fast. The sample is
//! deterministic, so an offset that fails once fails every time.
//!
//! **Correctness, not merely liveness.** "did not panic" is a weak bar:
//! an engine that silently serves half a table clears it. Every trial
//! here reads the whole database back and requires one of exactly two
//! outcomes:
//!
//! * a loud refusal or a loud read error, or
//! * data that matches what was actually written.
//!
//! Wrong values, invented keys, a forward scan that disagrees with a
//! point lookup, a reverse scan that disagrees with the forward one, and
//! a scan that stops early while `status()` reports success are all
//! failures, not passes. Those are the ways an LSM engine returns
//! silently wrong data, and none of them are visible to a test that only
//! checks for a panic.
//!
//! A panic raised on a *background* thread would be invisible to the test
//! harness, so `harness::watch_engine_panics` installs a hook that records
//! any panic originating outside `tests/`, and every sweep asserts that none
//! were recorded. A hang would be equally invisible, so every test body
//! runs on a worker thread whose progress counter is watched from the
//! test thread with a deadline plus bounded backoff.
