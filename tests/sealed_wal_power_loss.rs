//! A rotation must leave the log it seals durable.
//!
//! Recovery tolerates a torn tail only in the newest write-ahead log: an
//! earlier one is taken to have been complete when the rotation that created
//! its successor happened. Under the default `Eventual` durability nothing
//! syncs a log on its own, so unless the rotation does, a power cut between
//! the rotation and the flush that retires the sealed log can tear its tail
//! while a newer log exists, and the database then refuses to open.

// The whole file drives the `LD_PRELOAD` syscall shim, which exists only
// on Linux. Gated at the file level, like the other shim-backed suites.
