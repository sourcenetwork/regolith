//! Adversarial probe for the discarded-table open guard (the discarded-table open guard) under the
//! tear modes a real filesystem produces that are not `Truncate`.
//!
//! The guard dismisses an unreferenced table only when the file proves
//! it holds nothing: it is zero bytes long, or its footer parses and its
//! index block is empty. Everything else counts, and the open refuses.
//!
//! A power cut inside the first flush does not always leave a
//! zero-length file. ext4 with the blocks already allocated leaves zeros
//! at full length, and a device that tears at sector granularity leaves
//! a prefix followed by unrelated bytes. Both keep every acknowledged
//! write in the fsynced WAL, so ideally both would open. Neither can be
//! told apart from a *complete* table whose tail a lost or misdirected
//! write zeroed or garbled, and the manifest that would have said which
//! is the thing that is damaged.
//!
//! So the two sides of the trade are:
//!
//! * dismiss the file and the open silently serves a database missing
//!   everything a real table held;
//! * count it and the open refuses loudly, names the file, deletes
//!   nothing, and the operator moves it aside and recovers every
//!   acknowledged write from the WAL.
//!
//! The second is the standing choice, because it is the recoverable one.
//! `a_first_flush_cut_that_leaves_an_unprovable_orphan_refuses_and_salvages`
//! measures its cost rather than hiding it, and is the regression gate
//! for that contract.

// The whole file drives the `LD_PRELOAD` syscall shim, which exists
// only on Linux: on macOS the loader equivalent is blocked by system
// integrity protection, and on Windows there is none. Gated at the file
// level, like the other shim-backed suites, so the tests are absent
// rather than failing where the substrate cannot run.
