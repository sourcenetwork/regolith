//! A power cut inside a database's first flush, under every tear mode a
//! real filesystem produces (E29).
//!
//! The cut leaves a table no durable manifest batch names, whole, zeroed or
//! torn, beside a manifest whose unsynced tail is torn. ext4 with the
//! blocks already allocated leaves zeros at full length, and a device that
//! tears at sector granularity leaves a prefix followed by unrelated bytes.
//!
//! The open used to refuse whenever such a table could hold data and the
//! manifest named no table, because it could not tell this crash from a
//! manifest whose first durable batch was later damaged. It now judges the
//! manifest's end by the rule a write-ahead log's tail follows: no later
//! batch proves the torn bytes were synced, so a crash left them, the table
//! is no part of the database, and every acknowledged write is in the
//! fsynced WAL. So every tear opens with every acknowledged write, and the
//! orphan is removed by the next open that replays the manifest whole.
//!
//! The refusal remains for what no crash produces: damage below a batch a
//! later sync proves (`src/engine/manifest/tail_tests.rs`), and a manifest
//! with no header beside a table that may hold data
//! (`open_and_corruption.rs`, `adversarial_open_guard.rs`).

// The whole file drives the `LD_PRELOAD` syscall shim, which exists
// only on Linux: on macOS the loader equivalent is blocked by system
// integrity protection, and on Windows there is none. Gated at the file
// level, like the other shim-backed suites, so the tests are absent
// rather than failing where the substrate cannot run.
