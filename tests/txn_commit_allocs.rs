//! A transaction commit must hand its buffered writes to the engine, not
//! copy them.
//!
//! The buffers are concurrent so that buffering can take `&self`. Reading
//! one back out through its borrowing iterator clones every key and every
//! value, which at commit is pure waste: the transaction is being
//! consumed, so nothing needs the map's own copies afterwards. The defect
//! this guards costs two allocations and a full byte copy of the write
//! buffer per commit, which on an `Options::embedded` budget of a few MiB
//! is enough to double peak footprint at the worst possible moment.
//!
//! Measured with a counting global allocator rather than a timer: the
//! copy is a byte-for-byte duplicate of the buffer, so counting bytes is
//! exact and load-independent where wall clock is neither.

// Native-only. wasm-pack builds every test target for wasm32, and this
// uses the filesystem.
