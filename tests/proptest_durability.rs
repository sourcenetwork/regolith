//! Property tests for durability, recovery and key ordering.
//!
//! `tests/proptest_invariants.rs` already property-tests a healthy
//! database: scans, snapshots, compaction and a clean reopen, all over
//! plain puts and deletes. This file extends that technique into the two
//! areas it does not reach.
//!
//! 1. **Model-based equivalence over the full write API.** A random
//!    sequence of puts, deletes, range deletes, merge operands and atomic
//!    `WriteBatch`es is applied to regolith and to a `BTreeMap` reference
//!    model, and the two are compared after *every* operation. A single
//!    disagreement anywhere in the sequence fails the case, so this is
//!    the strongest single test in the file.
//! 2. **Durability.** The same generated sequence is run in a child
//!    process that is killed part way through, the unsynced bytes are
//!    then thrown away with the `LD_PRELOAD` power-loss harness in
//!    `tests/common/fault.rs`, and the recovered database must equal the
//!    model after some prefix of the sequence.
//! 3. **Byte transparency and ordering under adversarial keys.** Keys
//!    and values that are empty, all zero, all `0xff`, or that end in
//!    the nine-byte trailer regolith appends to a user key internally, must
//!    round-trip exactly and must iterate in strict user-key order in
//!    both directions.
//!
//! The reference model, the seeded workload generator the child process
//! replays, and the failure-reporting helpers live in the `model`
//! submodule; this file holds the strategies and the properties.
//!
//! # Known failure
//!
//! Two tests here fail against the engine as it stands, and both fail
//! for the same reason:
//! `reverse_iteration_reaches_a_key_above_the_seek_to_last_probe` is the
//! deterministic reproducer, and
//! `iteration_is_in_strict_user_key_order` is the property test that
//! found it. `CfIter::seek_to_last` probes with
//! `cf_upper_bound - 1 || [0xff; 8]`, which is an upper bound only for
//! user keys of at most eight bytes, so any longer key beginning with
//! eight `0xff` bytes is unreachable by a backward walk even though
//! `get` and a forward scan both return it. They are left failing on
//! purpose: a test that found a bug is doing its job.
//!
//! # The property, stated precisely
//!
//! "No data loss" is the wrong bar. Under `DurabilityMode::Eventual`
//! (the default) recent writes are *allowed* to vanish. What is never
//! allowed is a state that is not reachable by applying some prefix of
//! the operations: no gap, no half-applied batch, no key the workload
//! never wrote, no broken iteration order. Under
//! `DurabilityMode::Immediate` the prefix must additionally cover every
//! operation that returned `Ok`.
//!
//! A `kill -9` on its own proves much less than it looks like it does,
//! because every byte the process wrote is still in the OS page cache
//! and the kernel goes on to write it out. The crash test below
//! therefore always follows the kill with
//! [`common::fault::simulate_power_loss`], which discards the bytes that
//! were never `fsync`ed.
//!
//! # Reproducing a failure
//!
//! `proptest` shrinks a failing case, prints the minimal failing input
//! and records the seed in a `.proptest-regressions` file beside this
//! one, which is replayed ahead of any new case on the next run. It
//! prints a notice first that it could not find a `lib.rs` or `main.rs`
//! for its preferred `SourceParallel` layout, then falls back to that
//! sibling file; `proptest_invariants` has one checked in for the same
//! reason. The crash test additionally carries an explicit `u64` seed in
//! its generated input and prints it in every failure message: the whole
//! operation sequence, the durability mode and the crash point are
//! regenerated from that seed and the operation count alone, in the
//! parent and in the child alike.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test --test proptest_durability
//! cargo test --test proptest_durability -- --ignored --skip crash_child
//! PROPTEST_CASES=512 cargo test --test proptest_durability
//! ```

// The whole file drives the `LD_PRELOAD` syscall shim, which exists only
// on Linux: macOS blocks the loader equivalent under system integrity
// protection and Windows has none. Gated at the file level, like the
// other shim-backed suites, so the tests are absent where the substrate
// cannot run rather than failing there.
