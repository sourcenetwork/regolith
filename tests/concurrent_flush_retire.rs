//! A memtable must never be retired before the SSTable holding its
//! contents is in the published version.
//!
//! Two paths reach a flush without excluding each other: a writer's
//! rotation, which runs under the commit pipeline's mutex, and
//! `drain_memtables`, which a checkpoint drives and which releases that
//! mutex before it flushes so a whole SSTable write does not block
//! writers. If both are inside the flush at once they take the same
//! victim, `frozen[0]`, and both retire "index 0" on the way out. The
//! second retirement drops a memtable nothing has flushed, so every
//! write it held disappears: a key that was only ever overwritten reads
//! as an older version, or as absent.
//!
//! This is the end-to-end half. It runs the two paths against each
//! other for real: many rounds of checkpoint-driven drain against
//! writers rotating a 16 KiB memtable constantly. Every key is written
//! once with a value naming its own index and never deleted, so any
//! disagreement at the end is a lost write and nothing else, both
//! before and after a reopen.
//!
//! It is a soak, not the regression gate. The interleaving is narrow
//! enough that this workload does not reliably reproduce it, which is
//! why the gate is the deterministic pair in
//! `src/engine/read_view.rs`: they construct the frozen list a racing
//! retirement leaves behind and check the retirement takes the right
//! memtable out of it.
