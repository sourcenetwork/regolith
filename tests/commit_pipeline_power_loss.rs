//! The lock-free commit pipeline across a power cut at every stage, plain
//! and encrypted at rest.
//!
//! The workload runs in a child process under the `LD_PRELOAD` shim. Four
//! threads commit at once, each a different kind of slot of the commit ring,
//! so every stage is reached by more than one thread and any of them may be
//! the one that decides, writes, syncs or publishes another's commit:
//!
//! - thread 0 commits optimistic transactions with the blocking `commit`;
//! - thread 1 commits them with `commit_nowait` on a queue of its own and
//!   waits for the ticket by polling, so the sync is a round a poll claims;
//! - thread 2 writes plain batches of two keys with `WriteOptions::sync`,
//!   durable whatever the database's own durability, so slots that wait for
//!   a sync sit between slots that do not;
//! - thread 3 writes single keys at the database's own durability.
//!
//! Each transaction bumps one shared counter, read through `get_for_update`,
//! so concurrent commits conflict and are decided against each other, and
//! writes a pair of keys of its own. Small memtables make the run rotate
//! logs and flush tables, each an ordered step through the ring.
//!
//! # Where the power is cut
//!
//! The pipeline's stages are reserve, decide, write, sync, apply and
//! publish. Only two of them touch the device, so those are where a cut
//! leaves a different disk:
//!
//! | stage a commit had reached | the cut |
//! |---|---|
//! | reserved or decided, no byte written | before the nth write of the log |
//! | written, in part or whole, not synced | after the nth write, with the unsynced bytes truncated, zeroed, replaced by garbage, or torn inside a sector |
//! | written, about to be synced | before the nth fsync of the log |
//! | durable, not yet applied, published or acknowledged | after the nth fsync |
//! | any, at a sync boundary earlier in the run | the journal cut before or after its kth sync |
//!
//! A commit applied or published and not yet durable is on disk exactly as
//! one written and not synced is, so the same cuts cover it; what those
//! stages add is the acknowledgement, and the check is that nothing
//! acknowledged as durable is lost.
//!
//! # What must hold after any of them
//!
//! - Each transaction's writes, and each batch's, survive together or not
//!   at all.
//! - Each thread's surviving commits are a prefix of the commits it made:
//!   recovery keeps the log's prefix with no hole, though records are
//!   written by position and not in order.
//! - The counter equals the number of surviving transactions: none was
//!   lost under another, none survived without its increment.
//! - Every commit acknowledged as durable survives: a synced batch always,
//!   and everything else when the database's durability is `Immediate`.
//! - The database reopens and goes on committing.
//!
//! # Linux only
//!
//! `LD_PRELOAD` interposition is a glibc mechanism; the file is compiled out
//! elsewhere. See `power_loss.rs` for what the shim does and does not prove.

/// is sound only for a run that retires none: with small memtables this

/// harness's limit and not the engine's. The cuts placed where the child
/// died, above, are the ones that run with rotations and flushes.
