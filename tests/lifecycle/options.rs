//! Reopening a populated database under different [`Options`] than it
//! was created with: the upgrade path.
//!
//! Every test here follows the same shape, driven by
//! [`assert_option_change_preserves_data`]: seed a directory under one
//! option set, reopen it under another and read every old key, write
//! more so the directory holds files built both ways, read the mix,
//! compact it, then reopen under the original options and read
//! everything again. An upgrade that is readable in only one direction
//! is still a trap, so the round trip is part of every case.
