//! Power cuts where the Phase 6 packages meet.
//!
//! - **Every flush path** (#268 x #265). The compaction worker, a writer after
//!   its commit, and a writer stopped by a stall each flush; a cut at any
//!   manifest sync, before or after it, or inside a table, keeps every
//!   acknowledged write and reads no key older than its last acknowledged
//!   version. A flush that unlinked its log before its table's batch was
//!   durable loses acknowledged writes here. (A flush that records no
//!   `min_wal_id` shows only once an unlink fails: `phase6_integration.rs`.)
//!   Every cut runs plain and encrypted at rest (#266).
//! - **A sealed manifest's torn tail** (#266 x #268). On an encrypted
//!   database a crash can tear an unsynced reservation batch and leave the
//!   reservation after it whole. The open opens each batch before it judges
//!   whether the writer synced it, so the tail is dropped and the database
//!   opens with the right key, and with no other.
//!
//! Each write of the workload overwrites one of a few keys and puts a key of
//! its own, in one batch, each value carrying the index of the write, at
//! Immediate durability, so every acknowledged write is durable when it is
//! acknowledged.
//!
//! # Linux only
//!
//! `LD_PRELOAD` interposition is a glibc mechanism; the file is compiled out
//! elsewhere. See `power_loss.rs` for what the shim does and does not prove.
