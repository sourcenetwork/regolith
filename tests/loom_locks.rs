//! Loom models of the pessimistic lock table (plan 4.6, 4.10; D49, D53).
//!
//! ```text
//! RUSTFLAGS="--cfg loom" cargo test --release --test loom_locks
//! ```
//!
//! The models live in `src/transaction/lock_loom.rs`, next to the
//! crate-private types they drive. What each proves:
//!
//! - **One holder per key**: two owners take, hold and release one key's
//!   lock; the value they guard is a loom cell, so two holders at once fail
//!   the model, and a waiter the release never wakes parks for good and
//!   fails it as a deadlock.
//! - **Bounded bypass**: a waiter keeps its place while another owner takes
//!   the lock back after every release; it loses at most `MAX_BYPASS` races
//!   (2 under loom) and is then handed the lock.
//! - **A wait reaches its own queue**: a transaction records its wait on its
//!   queue and polls while the holder releases; a wait left pending has one
//!   completion on its own queue, none on another, and is ready only once
//!   its queue's owner takes it in.
//! - **A retired entry is never used**: the last use of a table entry is
//!   given back while another caller takes one; never both.
//! - **No wait outlives close**: a wait queued while close marks the gate and
//!   wakes every waiter is told, or its call abandons it.
//!
//! Each is paired with a calibration that writes the one step the wrong way
//! and must fail.
