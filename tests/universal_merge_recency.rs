//! A universal L0 merge must not overtake a flush that landed while it ran.
//!
//! Recency inside L0 is position, not sequence number: a lookup walks the
//! level in reverse and takes the first match without comparing sequence
//! numbers across files. A merge that appends its output therefore claims the
//! newest slot. Nothing excludes a flush while a merge runs, so a memtable
//! flushed mid-merge installs a genuinely newer file first, and an appended
//! merge output then sits in front of it. The newer write reads as lost, with
//! no error, until some later merge happens to fold it in.

// Native-only. wasm-pack builds every test target for wasm32, and these use
// threads and the filesystem, neither of which exists there.
