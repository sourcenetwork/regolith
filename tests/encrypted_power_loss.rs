//! Power cuts on a database encrypted at rest.
//!
//! The rule `proofs/tla/WalRecovery.tla` checks with `Frame = "AEAD"`: a
//! record whose tag fails is an unusable record under the O < P rule, so a
//! power cut leaves a database that opens under the right key with every
//! acknowledged write (`RecoveryOpens`, `AckedSurvive`) and a gap-free
//! prefix (`NoGap`), and one that never opens under the wrong key
//! (`WrongKeyRefuses`). RED `StampNotSealed` is the reason a sealed log's
//! stamp is sealed and durable before the log exists: the cuts below land
//! on both sides of every step of a sealed log's creation (the staging
//! write, its sync, the first record after the rename).
//!
//! Every cut is reconstructed from the syscalls the child really issued, by
//! the `LD_PRELOAD` shim's journal, under each way a device can leave the
//! unsynced bytes.

// The whole file drives the `LD_PRELOAD` syscall shim, which exists only
// on Linux. Gated at the file level, like the other shim-backed suites.
