//! Adversarial probe for the torn-tail rule under the tear modes a power cut can leave
//! inside a WAL record.
//!
//! `Wal::replay` treats an *incomplete* trailing record as the end of
//! the log, which is the fix. A record whose bytes are all present but
//! wrong is treated as corruption and refuses the open. Truncation is
//! not the only thing a power cut leaves behind: a device that tears at
//! sector granularity, or a filesystem that allocated blocks it never
//! wrote, leaves the record's full length with garbage or zeros in it.
//! If that shape can reach the last WAL record, an ordinary crash
//! refuses the open and every earlier acknowledged write goes with it.

// The whole file drives the `LD_PRELOAD` syscall shim, which exists only
// on Linux: macOS blocks the loader equivalent under system integrity
// protection and Windows has none. Gated at the file level, like the
// other shim-backed suites, so the tests are absent where the substrate
// cannot run rather than failing there.
