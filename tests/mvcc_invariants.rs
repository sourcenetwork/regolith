//! MVCC and concurrency invariants, promoted from one-off probes into
//! permanent regression tests.
//!
//! `tests/concurrency.rs` covers the scenario shapes ported from
//! `db_test.cc`. This file covers the *engine* invariants underneath
//! them, the ones a scenario test can pass without ever exercising:
//!
//! 1. A snapshot's view is byte-identical for its whole life, whatever
//!    concurrent writers, deleters and compactions do to the keys it
//!    covers.
//! 2. A `WriteBatch` that overwrites a key set is never observed
//!    half-applied, so a reader never sees a mix of generations.
//! 3. A repeated read of one key never travels backwards in version.
//! 4. Delete, compact and reopen preserve the exact surviving version
//!    of every key.
//! 5. An iterator keeps serving its view after compaction unlinks the
//!    SSTable files beneath it (the pinned-`Arc` contract).
//! 6. A snapshot pins every version its reads need, including when an
//!    older snapshot is the one that has to hold the GC horizon back.
//!
//! # Why none of these can flake
//!
//! Every concurrent test here has the same shape. The writers do a
//! **bounded** amount of work and then leave. The readers do a fixed
//! minimum number of checks and then keep going until every writer has
//! left, so a slower machine gets *more* overlap, never less, and the
//! run still terminates. No assertion is on a count of anything the
//! scheduler decides: the counts are returned and reported, and only
//! floors ("at least the minimum ran") are asserted. There is no
//! `sleep` anywhere in this file.
//!
//! Bounding the writers matters for more than runtime. A long-lived
//! snapshot pins every version written under it, so a reader-paced
//! writer loop feeds back on itself: more retained versions make each
//! snapshot scan slower, which lets the writers write more. Fixing the
//! writer op count breaks that loop and keeps the data volume flat.
//!
//! Every workload is generated from a fixed seed, so a failure
//! reproduces byte for byte.
//!
//! The full-scale tests are larger versions of the same
//! properties; see each one's doc comment for its measured runtime.
//! `just mvcc` runs the fast set, `just mvcc-slow` the full-scale set.
