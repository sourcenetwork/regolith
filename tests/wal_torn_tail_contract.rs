//! Independent adversarial review of the torn-WAL-tail contract.
//!
//! Written against the public API only, with its own fixture, its own
//! record-framing oracle and its own prefix check, so it shares no helper
//! with the suite it is checking. It asserts both halves of the
//! benign/malignant split the fix rests on:
//!
//! * benign, and therefore recoverable with every earlier write intact:
//!   the file ends inside its final record, at any offset;
//! * malignant, and therefore an error: damage in the middle of the log
//!   with whole records still after it, and a whole final record whose
//!   checksum does not match.
//!
//! A fix that turned the second class into "discard and carry on" would
//! silently lose acknowledged writes, so every case below pins the
//! direction as well as the outcome.
