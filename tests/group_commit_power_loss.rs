//! Optimistic transactions committed in shared groups across a power cut.
//!
//! The workload runs in a child process under the `LD_PRELOAD` shim: several
//! threads commit optimistic transactions that each bump one shared counter
//! (read through `get_for_update`, so concurrent commits conflict, inside a
//! group as across groups) and write a pair of keys of their own. The child
//! dies at the nth write or fsync of the log, the directory is rebuilt as the
//! filesystem would have left it, discarding every byte never synced, and the
//! database is reopened. Small memtables make the run rotate logs and flush
//! tables on the way.
//!
//! - Each transaction's writes survive together or not at all, whichever
//!   group carried it and wherever the cut tore that group.
//! - Each thread's surviving commits are a prefix of the commits it made.
//! - The counter equals the number of surviving commits: no surviving commit
//!   was lost under another, and none survived without its increment.
//! - At Immediate every acknowledged commit survives; a commit is
//!   acknowledged only once the fsync of its group returned.
//!
//! Every run is made twice: plain, and encrypted at rest, where each group
//! is one sealed record (#266 x #265).
//!
//! # Linux only
//!
//! `LD_PRELOAD` interposition is a glibc mechanism; the file is compiled out
//! elsewhere. See `power_loss.rs` for what the shim does and does not prove.
