//! The compaction gate is fair both ways and no call waits on it (plan 4.6,
//! E28).
//!
//! - **E28.** An endless stream of exclusive users (`compact_range`, an
//!   ingest, a checkpoint) never starves the compaction worker, and writers
//!   never stall behind it: the worker takes turns between the jobs and its
//!   own flushes and passes.
//! - **A poll never waits.** A job on a caller's queue that finds the gate
//!   held by a pass parks there; the poll returns at once, and the queue's
//!   owner is woken once the job may go on.
//! - **A caller's pass never waits.** `compact_step` reports `Contended`
//!   while a job holds the gate.
