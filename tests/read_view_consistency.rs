//! Independent adversarial review of the published read view.
//!
//! The fix publishes the active memtable, the frozen memtables and the
//! version as one immutable object, so a read resolves every source at
//! one point in time. These probes attack the two shapes the shipped
//! suite does not cover directly:
//!
//! * `drop_all` running under read load. It is the one operation that
//!   moves data in the *newer* direction, emptying every source at once,
//!   so it is where "successive views only move data older" is most
//!   likely to be violated.
//! * a `Snapshot` held open while compaction rewrites and unlinks the
//!   files underneath it, which is what the view's pin chain exists for.
//!
//! The invariant asserted throughout is the one the bug report names: a
//! key that is only ever overwritten, never deleted, must never read back
//! as absent, and a repeated read of it must never travel backwards.
