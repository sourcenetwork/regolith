//! Scenario 5: blind merges under `DefraLevel`, on the optimistic flavour.
//!
//! Eight transactions each merge `+1` into one hot counter without reading
//! it, and every one has a write forced onto the counter between its begin
//! and its commit, through the helper thread. All eight snapshots are taken
//! before any forced write lands and every commit comes after the last of
//! them, so all eight forced writes sit inside every transaction's window.
//! A round gives the eight the same kind of write, so whatever lands in a
//! window is of that kind: a round of operands must commit at `DefraLevel`
//! and a round with a put, a delete or a range delete in it must not.
//!
//! The counter is a sum with a partial merge, so compaction may fold operands
//! by itself. A flush or a compaction can follow the first forced write or
//! the last one, which puts a replacement in the memtable, in a table, under
//! operands, or compacted away from its snapshot. After every round, and at
//! the end, the counter must equal a model replayed from what the helper
//! landed.
//!
//! A round of transactions that read the counter before they merge is the
//! control: their merge is no longer blind, so they abort whatever lands.
//!
//! The pessimistic flavour has no counterpart here. Its first merge takes the
//! counter's lock, so eight transactions cannot all have merged before any
//! commits, and its blind writes are not validated at all.
//!
//! Threads here never assert between two rendezvous, since a thread that
//! panicked would strand the rest; they record what they saw and the test
//! judges after the scope has ended.
