//! Scenario 6: a scan inside a commutative prefix under `DefraLevel`, on the
//! optimistic flavour (the pessimistic one takes no key classifier).
//!
//! The database declares the keys under `h/` a commutative prefix. Eight
//! transactions each begin, scan the heads, write one key of their own and
//! one key that is fresh to the round and that all eight write with the same
//! bytes, and only when all eight have done so does the first of them commit.
//! The commits then overlap by construction.
//!
//! With the classifier, at `DefraLevel`, a scan that stays inside the prefix
//! records no stretch, so the fresh key is a blind write of bytes another
//! commit already stored and all eight commit. Anywhere else the stretch is
//! recorded, the fresh key lies inside it and is validated as read from the
//! begin snapshot, and only the first commit survives: that is every other
//! level, and `DefraLevel` too when the scan walks on to a key outside the
//! prefix. The refused seven retry until they commit, and the keys of every
//! round must all be there afterwards.
//!
//! On `Tables` the first commit is made alone and flushed behind, so the
//! seven others are judged against a version that lives in a table.
//!
//! Threads here never assert between two rendezvous, since a thread that
//! panicked would strand the rest; they record what they saw and the test
//! judges after the scope has ended.
