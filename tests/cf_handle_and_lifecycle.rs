//!
//! 1. A handle that is not live is an error, not an empty column family.
//! 2. `drop_all` drops everything, including what a compaction was midway
//!    through writing.
//! 3. `close` returns, even when an ingest holds the compaction gate.

// Native-only. wasm-pack builds every test target for wasm32, and these use
// threads and the filesystem, neither of which exists there.
