//! A power cut during a database's first flush (E29).
//!
//! A flush writes and syncs its table, makes it part of the database with
//! one synced manifest batch, and only then removes the log that held its
//! writes. The batches the manifest takes before that one only reserve file
//! ids and are never synced on their own. A cut inside the first flush
//! therefore tears an unsynced manifest tail while the table, whole or
//! torn, sits in the table directory and no durable batch names it. A crash
//! produces that state, and every write is still in the log, so the
//! database opens. Whatever the cut and whatever the tear:
//!
//! - the database opens;
//! - every acknowledged write survives;
//! - once the flush's batch was synced, its table is part of the database.
//!
//! # Linux only
//!
//! `LD_PRELOAD` interposition is a glibc mechanism; the file is compiled out
//! elsewhere. See `power_loss.rs` for what the shim does and does not prove.
