//! Real process-kill crash consistency for the group-commit write path.
//!
//! Every other durability test in this tree fails an fsync in-process and
//! reopens the engine in the same address space. That never exercises the
//! thing group commit changed most: a group's WAL bytes, its memtable
//! inserts and its published horizon are now produced by a *different*
//! thread than the one that asked for the write. This target kills the
//! whole process part-way through a concurrent durable write load and
//! then checks the survivors.
//!
//! The invariant under test needs no bookkeeping file. Writer `w` writes
//! `w/0`, `w/1`, `w/2`, ... strictly in order, and each `put` returns only
//! after the engine has declared that write durable. So on recovery the
//! keys present for writer `w` must be a *prefix* of its sequence: a hole
//! means the engine acknowledged `i` as durable, then lost it while
//! keeping the later `i + 1`.
