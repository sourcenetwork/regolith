//! A `multi_get` on a database with a merge operator must resolve every key
//! against the one read view it loaded.
//!
//! The batch picks its read sequence against that view. Resolving a key
//! against a view loaded later lets a compaction that ran in between drop the
//! version the sequence admits in favour of a newer one it does not, and the
//! key reads back as absent: a read that travels backwards.
//!
//! The merge operator is the interleaving point. It runs while the first key
//! is resolved, so what it does there lands between the batch's keys.

// Native-only. wasm-pack builds every test target for wasm32, and these use
// the filesystem, which does not exist there.
