//! Compaction workers must never claim the same input files twice.
//!
//! A level below L0 is read as a single sorted run: the iterator walks its
//! files in key order and expects each key to be greater than the last. Two
//! workers that pick the same inputs produce two output sets covering the
//! same key range, both of which land in the target level. The level is
//! then not sorted, and a scan across it either reports that iteration went
//! backwards or silently stops at the first key that does not advance.
//!
//! The invariant is checked the way a reader would meet it: scan everything
//! and require that the keys strictly increase and that every key written
//! comes back exactly once.

// Native-only. wasm-pack builds every test target for wasm32, and these use
