//! Power-loss durability tests.
//!
//! These are the tests behind the README's "WAL crash recovery" claim.
//! They are deliberately not process-kill tests: killing a process leaves
//! every byte it wrote sitting in the OS page cache, and the kernel writes
//! those bytes out afterwards, so a `kill -9` proves the engine survives
//! losing its *memory* and nothing more. A power cut discards everything
//! that was never `fsync`ed, which is a strictly harsher failure and the
//! only one that can tell an honest durability claim from a lucky one.
//!
//! # The mechanism used here, stated so nobody over-reads the results
//!
//! Every test in this file crashes a real child process at a byte-exact
//! point and then reconstructs the directory with
//! [`common::fault::simulate_power_loss`]. That reconstruction is driven by
//! a pure-Rust `LD_PRELOAD` interposer (`tests/common/fault/preload_shim.rs`)
//! which records the child's real `write`/`pwrite`/`writev`/`fsync`/
//! `fdatasync`/`open`/`ftruncate`/`rename`/`unlink` stream with byte offsets
//! and thread ids. The reconstruction replays that stream, computes the byte
//! ranges never followed by a successful `fsync` on their file, and rewrites
//! the directory the way the filesystem would have left it. It is the ALICE
//! model driven by what regolith actually did, not by an assumption about what
//! regolith does.
//!
//! Interposition is sound for this engine because regolith performs all data
//! I/O through `std::fs` (glibc symbols); it uses `rustix` raw syscalls only
//! for `flock` and `fadvise`, which move no file data, and it has no `mmap`
//! write path.
//!
//! ## What these tests therefore DO prove
//!
//! * That a write acknowledged under `DurabilityMode::Immediate` was really
//!   on stable storage, not merely in the page cache.
//! * That the state regolith recovers is a valid prefix of the write history:
//!   some `k` writes applied in order, no gap, no half-applied `WriteBatch`,
//!   no key the workload never wrote, and an intact iteration order.
//! * That the above still holds when the cut lands inside a memtable flush,
//!   inside a compaction, inside a MANIFEST append, and inside a recovery
//!   from an earlier cut.
//!
//! ## What they do NOT prove
//!
//! * Nothing about resurrection of an `unlink`ed file whose directory was
//!   never synced. Undoing an unlink needs the file's contents, which the
//!   journal does not carry; not resurrecting is the milder outcome, so
//!   these tests are weaker than reality on that one axis.
//! * Nothing about write reordering below the granularity of a single
//!   `write` call, nor about the cache behaviour of a specific device.
//! * Nothing about a filesystem that exposes a tear these tests do not
//!   model. Two realistic tears are exercised ([`TearMode::Truncate`], the
//!   usual journalling-filesystem outcome, and [`TearMode::TornSector`]);
//!   which one a given filesystem produces changes the outcome, and
//!   [`a_write_batch_is_all_or_nothing_at_every_cut_point`] records that.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Every workload is generated from a fixed seed, every kill point is the
//! nth matching syscall counted by the shim rather than a wall-clock
//! deadline, and every byte of injected garbage comes from a seeded stream.
//! There is no `sleep` anywhere in this file. A fast machine and a slow one
//! crash at the same byte.
//!
//! # Acknowledgement bookkeeping
//!
//! The harness records the index of every write that returned `Ok` in a file
//! outside the database directory, so a power-loss reconstruction cannot
//! rewrite it. That record ends where the child died, so it may only be
//! compared against a reconstruction taken at [`CutPoint::End`]. Tests that
//! cut earlier assert the prefix property, never the acknowledgement
//! contract.
//!
//! # Runtime
//!
//! Each test's doc comment states its measured runtime. Every test spawns
//! at least one child process, and the slowest takes 0.31s, so none of them
//! is switched off: the whole file runs in well under a second
//! and stays in the default `cargo test`. `just test-power` runs it with
//! output shown, which is how the measured `Eventual` loss is read off.

//! # Linux only
//!
//! Every test here drives a child process under the `LD_PRELOAD` fault
//! shim, which is how unsynced bytes are discarded to model a power
//! cut rather than a process kill. `LD_PRELOAD` interposition is a
//! glibc mechanism, so on any other target the shim cannot be built.
//! The file is compiled out there rather than failing at run time: a
//! test that panics because the platform cannot host its mechanism
//! reports a defect that does not exist.
