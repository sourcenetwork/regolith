//! Every method of every trait a caller implements is called by regolith,
//! with the caller's own data.
//!
//! One module per trait: an implementation that records every call, a small
//! workload that reaches each method, and an assertion per method on what it
//! was handed.
//!
//! The traits whose every call already has such a test are covered where
//! their keys are: `MergeOperator` in `tests/merge_operator_key.rs`,
//! `CompactionFilter` in `tests/compaction_filter_key.rs`, `PrefixExtractor`
//! in `tests/prefix_extractor_key.rs`, and `TransactionHooks` with a
//! transaction's own callbacks in `tests/transaction_callbacks.rs`. Their
//! `name` methods are asked here.

// Native-only. wasm-pack builds every test target for wasm32, and the browser
// suite lives in tests/wasm_opfs*.rs.
