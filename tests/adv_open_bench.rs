//! Proves `Db::open` reads SSTable metadata, not SSTable data.
//!
//! Open touches, per SSTable: a footer, an index block, a bloom filter
//! (all three a function of file count and key count), and - measured
//! here, not assumed - exactly one data block per file, because
//! `Db::open` seeks the merging iterator across the reserved
//! column-family-registry key range to discover any persisted CF names
//! (`Db::load_cf_registry`). That seek lands on each file's first data
//! block and never reads a second one, so it costs one `block_size`
//! chunk per file, not per entry or per on-disk byte. None of this is
//! observable as a byte count anywhere in the public API, so this test
//! installs a `CountingEnv` (the same decorator pattern as
//! `vectored_syscalls.rs`) that wraps `StdEnv` and sums `read_exact_at`
//! bytes, bucketed by directory (`sst/`, `MANIFEST`, `wal/`) from the
//! path each `ReadFile` was opened with. Counters are reset immediately
//! before `Db::open` and read immediately after, so the window is
//! exactly the open call.
//!
//! Two databases, DB-A and DB-B, are built with the same file count and
//! the same keys; the only difference is DB-B's values are ~8x larger,
//! which puts its on-disk `sst/` bytes at ~6.5x DB-A's (measured; see
//! the comment on the premise check). If open's cost is bounded per
//! file rather than per byte, the bytes it reads at open barely move
//! between the two; if open ever streamed data proportional to file
//! size, the read bytes would track the on-disk bytes instead. That
//! gives three assertions, all byte counts and ratios captured in one
//! run, none of them wall-clock:
//!
//! 1. A premise self-check: the on-disk byte ratio really is large and
//!    the decorator really measured something nonzero, so the test
//!    cannot pass by comparing two things that are actually the same,
//!    or by measuring nothing.
//! 2. An absolute budget: bytes read from `sst/` at open must be a
//!    minority of the on-disk `sst/` total, for both databases. The
//!    per-file data block pushes this well above what footer/index/
//!    bloom alone would cost, so the bound below is pinned to what was
//!    actually measured, not to that smaller arithmetic estimate.
//! 3. The invariance leg: the ratio of sst-bytes-read-at-open between
//!    DB-B and DB-A must stay far below the on-disk byte ratio between
//!    them. This is the metadata-vs-data distinction, expressed as a
//!    same-run ratio so machine speed and disk never enter it. The
//!    per-file data block does not break this: it is one `block_size`
//!    chunk regardless of value size, so it is close to the same
//!    absolute cost in both databases and barely moves the ratio.
//!
//! `Db::open`'s wall-clock cost is still measured and printed as a
//! reported-only figure, in the same spirit as the vectored write-count
//! test: informative, never asserted.
