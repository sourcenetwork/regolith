//! The read-only anomaly of Fekete, O'Neil and O'Neil (2004) against the
//! real engine, with a report that writes nothing at every isolation level.
//!
//! Two balances `x` and `y` start at 0. A withdrawal reads both and takes 10
//! from `x`, and one more when their total would go below zero. A deposit
//! adds 20 to `y`. Both run at `SnapshotIsolation`. The withdrawal reads
//! first; the deposit commits; a report then reads both balances (it sees
//! the deposit and not the withdrawal); the withdrawal commits, charged the
//! penalty on the total it read. No order of the three gives what the
//! report saw: the penalty puts the withdrawal before the deposit, and the
//! report puts the deposit before the withdrawal.
//!
//! A report at `RepeatableRead` or `Serializable` checks its reads at its
//! commit, so one that commits after the withdrawal finds `x` changed and is
//! refused: it never returns the impossible balance sheet. Its commit takes
//! no part in the commit pipeline (E50), and the check there is what keeps
//! it. A report at `ReadCommitted` or `SnapshotIsolation`, and an optimistic
//! one at `DefraLevel`, checks nothing, commits, and saw one snapshot: what
//! those levels promise, and why the type's docs tell callers to give the
//! writers a validating level. With the writers at `RepeatableRead` the
//! withdrawal is refused and every report is consistent, whenever it
//! commits.
