//! `commit_nowait` across a power cut, at both durabilities.
//!
//! The workload runs in a child process under the `LD_PRELOAD` shim: several
//! threads commit optimistic transactions that each bump one shared counter
//! (read through `get_for_update`, so concurrent commits conflict) and write
//! a pair of keys of their own. Half the threads commit with `commit_nowait`
//! on an I/O queue of their own and wait for the ticket by polling that
//! queue; the other half commit with the blocking `commit`, so groups mix
//! members whose fsync is a claimable unit with members that run it
//! themselves. A thread records a commit as acknowledged only once its
//! outcome is known: the ticket's at its own poll, or `commit`'s return. The
//! child dies at the nth write or fsync of the log, the directory is rebuilt
//! as the filesystem would have left it, discarding every byte never synced,
//! and the database is reopened.
//!
//! - Each transaction's writes survive together or not at all.
//! - Each thread's surviving commits are a prefix of the commits it made:
//!   groups land in the order they were written, whoever runs their fsync.
//! - The counter equals the number of surviving commits.
//! - At Immediate every acknowledged commit survives: a ticket is ready only
//!   once its group's fsync returned.
//!
//! # Linux only
//!
//! `LD_PRELOAD` interposition is a glibc mechanism; the file is compiled out
//! elsewhere. See `power_loss.rs` for what the shim does and does not prove.
