//! Read-your-own-writes and lock-order probes for the published read
//! view (the published read view).
//!
//! Publication is a compare-exchange, so there is no publish mutex for
//! a version edit to nest under the version-set mutex and no lock order
//! left to invert. This still drives every publisher at once (rotation,
//! foreground flush, background compaction, `compact_range`,
//! `drop_all`) with a watchdog that fails instead of hanging: the
//! liveness question survives the mutex that prompted it, because a
//! compare-exchange retry loop has its own way to make no progress.
//!
//! Read-your-own-writes is the other half: a thread that writes a key
//! and immediately reads it back must see at least what it just wrote,
//! whatever rotation or flush lands between the two calls.
