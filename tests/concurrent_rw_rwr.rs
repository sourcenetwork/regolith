//! Concurrent read-write (RW) and read-write-read (RWR) transactions, eight
//! threads each, at every isolation level: the gate the isolation work has
//! to clear before anything builds on the levels.
//!
//! Every scenario forces the interleaving it is about rather than hoping a
//! scheduler produces it. A rendezvous lines the threads up inside their
//! transactions, or a helper thread commits between two reads and
//! acknowledges before the second one, so each invariant is checked
//! against a history that actually contains the hazard. Where a scenario
//! also runs freely, it requires evidence that the free run overlapped.
//! Every wait has a deadline, and a helper ends when the last thread that can
//! ask it for anything is gone.
//!
//! Scenarios 1 to 4 and 7 run on both transaction flavours; 5 and 6 need the
//! optimistic one. Every scenario runs on two storage shapes: the default,
//! where only the active memtable is ever probed, and a small write buffer
//! with flushes in the worker loops, where the conflict probes walk SSTables
//! too. A scenario claims a probe reached a table only after counting block
//! cache lookups on the committing thread.
//!
//! 1. Lost update. Eight transactions read one counter at the same value,
//!    then all commit `value + 1`. Exactly one may commit at every level and
//!    on both flavours; the rest retry, and the counter ends at exactly the
//!    number of increments.
//! 2. Snapshot sum. An auditor reads part of a set of accounts, a transfer
//!    out of a read account into an unread one commits, and the auditor
//!    reads the rest: its total is still the initial total. Then eight
//!    writers transfer freely until an audit has seen a commit land inside
//!    it, and every audit and the final state hold the total.
//! 3. Repeatable point read. Each of eight readers reads a shared key, a
//!    writer commits a new value and acknowledges, and the reader reads the
//!    key again: the same value, at every level. It reads with `get` and with
//!    `get_for_update`, then writes its own key and reads it back. The commit
//!    aborts exactly at the levels that validate that kind of read.
//! 4. Repeatable scan. Each of eight readers scans a prefix, an inserter
//!    commits a new key into it and acknowledges, and the reader scans
//!    again: the same keys, every seeded key among them, one of them read
//!    first with `get` or `get_for_update`. A transaction begun afterwards
//!    sees the insertion.
//! 5. Blind merges (`DefraLevel`, optimistic). Eight transactions merge into
//!    one hot counter without reading it, and every one has a write forced
//!    onto the counter between its begin and its commit: another operand, a
//!    put, a delete or a range delete. Operands never abort a blind merge at
//!    `DefraLevel`, and a replacement always does; the counter is checked
//!    against a model after every round, with and without a flush or a
//!    compaction in between.
//! 6. Commutative prefix (`DefraLevel`, optimistic). Eight transactions scan
//!    a head prefix and write a key of their own and one fresh key they all
//!    write alike: with a classifier all commit at `DefraLevel`, at any other
//!    level one does, and so does a scan that leaves the prefix.
//! 7. Scan reader commits. A reader scans, a write to a row it was returned
//!    commits, and then the reader commits: only `Serializable` validates a
//!    scan, but a row the reader scanned and then writes is validated at
//!    every level.
