//! The key layout of a commit-ordered log.
//!
//! A commit-ordered log is a run of entries numbered 1, 2, 3, ... in the order
//! their transactions commit. [`crate::Transaction::append`] adds an entry,
//! and regolith picks its position while the commit is being ordered, so
//! positions follow commit order and have no holes. regolith does not know
//! what the keys mean: a [`LogLayout`] tells it where the log keeps them.

/// Where one commit-ordered log keeps its keys. Implement it once per log and
/// share it behind an [`Arc`](std::sync::Arc).
///
/// A log owns three kinds of key, and no key belongs to two logs:
///
/// - the **head key**, which holds the newest position as an 8-byte
///   big-endian `u64`, absent while the log is empty;
/// - one **entry key** per position, which holds the entry's bytes;
/// - optionally one **once key** per `append` call that names one, which holds
///   the position its entry was given as an 8-byte big-endian `u64`.
///
/// regolith writes all three, in the same atomic commit that numbers the
/// entry. A caller reads them like any other key, and must not write them. A
/// reader that reads the head key in a snapshot and then the entries up to it
/// finds every entry present, because positions are numbered in commit order
/// and become visible with their commit.
///
/// # Contract
///
/// The methods run inside the ordered step of a commit, which holds up every
/// other writer, so each must be quick, pure and deterministic: no I/O, no
/// blocking, no panic, and no call back into the database. The same input
/// always gives the same output, for the life of the database and across
/// reopens, since positions already written are never renumbered.
///
/// - [`head_key`](LogLayout::head_key) never changes and is not an entry key
///   of any position.
/// - [`entry_key`](LogLayout::entry_key) gives a different key for every
///   position, and none is longer than
///   [`max_entry_key_len`](LogLayout::max_entry_key_len).
///
/// Breaking the contract is not detected in full. A layout that gives two
/// positions one key overwrites the earlier entry; a layout whose keys
/// overlap another log's mixes the two logs. regolith checks only what it
/// can cheaply: that no entry key is longer than the declared maximum, and,
/// when a [`crate::KeyClassifier`] is installed, that the keys are classified
/// [`crate::KeyClass::Log`].
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use regolith::LogLayout;
///
/// /// Entries at `journal/<20 decimal digits>`, head at `journal-head`.
/// struct Journal;
///
/// impl LogLayout for Journal {
///     fn head_key(&self) -> &[u8] {
///         b"journal-head"
///     }
///
///     fn entry_key(&self, position: u64, out: &mut Vec<u8>) {
///         out.extend_from_slice(format!("journal/{position:020}").as_bytes());
///     }
///
///     fn max_entry_key_len(&self) -> usize {
///         "journal/".len() + 20
///     }
/// }
/// ```
pub trait LogLayout: Send + Sync + 'static {
