//! Bounded retries owned by regolith: [`OptimisticTransactionDb::transact`]
//! and [`TransactionDb::transact`] run a closure in a transaction, commit it,
//! and run it again when the commit loses a race.
//!
//! A re-run starts at once. A one-winner race resolves on the re-run, which
//! sees the winner, so nothing sleeps. The closure receives the [`Conflict`]
//! the previous attempt lost to, so it can resolve the race instead of
//! redoing the same work blindly.
//!
//! A policy may ask for a bounded wait before each re-run instead
//! ([`RetryPolicy::backoff`]), measured on the clock of the database's
//! [`Env`](crate::Env). `transact` then waits on its own thread, which is
//! the thread that chose a blocking call; `transact_async` waits on its
//! queue, whose poll ends the wait, so nothing there blocks. A policy that
//! does not ask reads no clock.
//!
//! [`OptimisticTransactionDb::transact_async`] is the same contract for a
//! caller that must never block: each attempt reads through a
//! `CacheOnly` handle on the caller's queue, a block-cache miss suspends the
//! attempt on its wait instead of ending it, and the commit goes through
//! `commit_nowait`, whose ticket the attempt awaits. It needs no runtime: the
//! caller's executor polls the future, and the caller's thread polls its
//! queue when it has nothing else to run ([`crate::IoQueue::block_on`] does
//! both).
