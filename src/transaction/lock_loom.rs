//! Loom models of the pessimistic lock table: taking a key's lock, releasing
//! it, and waiting for it; and of the first four `on_abort` callbacks a
//! transaction's claim holds in place, pushed by its owner while `close`
//! takes them (`tests/loom_locks.rs` runs them).
//!
//! Each positive model drives the production types: [`OwnedLock`] and
//! [`OwnedWait`], [`KeyLock`]'s use count, [`PendingLock`] and the queue a
//! wait is delivered to, whose atomics and cells come from
//! `crate::sync::internal` and so are loom's under `--cfg loom`. Each
//! calibration writes the one step it breaks the wrong way and must fail;
//! without it, a search that never reached the bad interleaving would pass
//! for the same reason a broken protocol does.
//!
//! The map the table keeps its locks in is not loom's, so the models hold a
//! key's lock directly; what the map adds, one entry per key, rests on the
//! use count modelled in `a_retired_entry_is_never_used`.
