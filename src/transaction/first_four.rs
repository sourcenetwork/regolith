//! A hand-off list whose first four entries live in place.
//!
//! A transaction's `on_abort` callbacks sit in its claim, shared with `close`
//! (`super::claim`). One thread, the transaction's owner, pushes them; the
//! thread that ends the transaction takes them, and the owner takes what
//! was pushed after that at the end. The first [`IN_PLACE`] pushes go to
//! slots inside the list itself, so a transaction with a few callbacks
//! allocates nothing for them beyond the claim; later ones go to a
//! [`Handoff`].
//!
//! Invariants this module holds:
//!
//! - One thread pushes. Slots fill in order, and the overflow is used only
//!   once every slot was filled.
//! - A slot is taken once: the taker moves it from full to taken with one
//!   compare-and-swap, and nothing fills it again.
//! - A take stops at the first slot not filled yet, and reaches the
//!   overflow only past four filled slots, so entries come out oldest first
//!   across takes as well as within one.
