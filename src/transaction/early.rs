//! Early validation ([`TxnOptions::early_validation`]): a write checks its key
//! against newer versions as it is made, so a doomed transaction stops before
//! it does more work.
//!
//! The check is the commit's own check of a written key (see
//! `engine::commit::write_check`), asked of this one write as if it were the
//! transaction's only. It is advisory in both directions, which is safe
//! because only the commit decides: a key can change after the check, and a
//! write that failed it could have passed had it waited.
