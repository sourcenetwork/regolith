impl Transaction {
    /// Adds `entry` to the commit-ordered log `log` describes, at the
    /// position the commit gives it.
    ///
    /// Nothing is written until commit. In the ordered step of the commit,
    /// after the transaction's reads are validated and before the write-ahead
    /// log is written, regolith:
    ///
    /// 1. skips the append, writing nothing, when `once_key` is given and
    ///    already holds a position, whether from an earlier commit or from an
    ///    earlier `append` of this transaction or of a commit in the same
    ///    group;
    /// 2. otherwise gives the entry the log's next position `p`, one past the
    ///    newest position any earlier commit, or earlier `append` of this
    ///    commit, took: dense from 1; and
    /// 3. writes `entry_key(p) = entry`, `once_key = p` (when given, as an
    ///    8-byte big-endian number) and `head_key = p`, in the same atomic
    ///    commit as the transaction's other writes.
    ///
    /// # Guarantees
    ///
    /// - **Commit order, no holes.** Positions follow commit order. Several
    ///   appends to one log in one transaction take consecutive positions in
    ///   the order they were made. A transaction that aborts, fails
    ///   validation or fails to reach the log takes no position, and the next
    ///   commit reuses it. A reader that reads the head key in a snapshot, and
    ///   then the entries up to it, finds every one of them that no commit at
    ///   or before its snapshot dropped with [`Transaction::truncate_log`].
    /// - **Never a conflict.** An append is never validated, so it cannot
    ///   fail a commit and no other commit's write can fail it. The head key
    ///   is not part of the transaction's read or write set, so two
    ///   transactions that append to one log and touch nothing else in
    ///   common both commit. This holds at every isolation level, for an
    ///   optimistic and a pessimistic transaction alike; `append` takes no
    ///   lock.
    /// - **At most once.** Of any number of appends sharing a `once_key`, in
    ///   one transaction or in many, only the first to commit writes an
    ///   entry. The key then holds the entry's position, so a caller can
    ///   look an entry up by it.
    /// - **Own appends are invisible at a position.** The positions do not
    ///   exist until commit, so nothing this transaction reads, a scan of the
    ///   log or its head included, shows its own appends. To see the entries
    ///   themselves, without positions, use [`Transaction::appended`].
    /// - **Rollback.** A savepoint saves the appends made before it, and
    ///   `rollback_to_savepoint` drops those made after.
    ///
    /// Durability is the database's. Under
    /// [`DurabilityMode::Eventual`](crate::DurabilityMode::Eventual) a crash
    /// can lose committed appends, and the next commit then gives their
    /// positions to other entries; the database stays consistent, but a
    /// consumer outside it that recorded a position should use
    /// [`DurabilityMode::Immediate`](crate::DurabilityMode::Immediate).
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Refused here, with the transaction unchanged, as
    /// [`Error::InvalidArgument`]: a layout whose entry key for the largest
    /// position is longer than [`LogLayout::max_entry_key_len`], and, when a
    /// [`KeyClassifier`] is installed and applies to this transaction (an
    /// optimistic transaction at [`IsolationLevel::DefraLevel`]), a layout
    /// whose head or entry key, or a `once_key`, the classifier does not
    /// declare [`KeyClass::Log`]. At commit, a key or entry beyond the
    /// database's size limits, a commit too large to log, a head or once key
    /// that holds anything but eight bytes, or a layout that builds an entry
    /// key longer than it declared fails the commit with
    /// [`Error::InvalidArgument`], and nothing is applied.
    ///
    /// # Preconditions
    ///
    /// Only appends and [`Transaction::truncate_log`] write the keys of a
    /// log, and a truncate writes only deletes of entry keys. A write to them
    /// by anything else, a plain [`Db::put`](crate::Db::put) or a pessimistic
    /// transaction (which consults no classifier) included, can number two
    /// entries alike or leave the head behind its entries, and regolith
