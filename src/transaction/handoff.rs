//! A list any thread pushes to and any thread takes whole, with no lock.
//!
//! A transaction's `on_abort` callbacks have two possible runners: its owner,
//! and `close` on another thread. Whoever wins the transaction's abort claim
//! (see `super::claim`) takes everything registered so far in one step and
//! runs it; a callback registered after that is simply left in the list, and
//! the owner takes it at the end of the transaction.
//!
//! The list is a Treiber stack that only ever grows at the head and is only
//! ever emptied by swapping the head out for null. No node is popped alone,
//! so a push never dereferences the head it read and the ABA problem has
//! nothing to attack. A taker owns the whole chain after the swap, reverses
//! it into push order, and frees each node as it hands the value out.
