//! The single-winner claim on a transaction's abort, shared with the engine.
//!
//! A transaction with an `on_abort` callback, or under a database with
//! [`TransactionHooks`](super::TransactionHooks), has to be abortable by a
//! thread that does not own it: `close` aborts every transaction still open.
//! The owner and the closer settle who ends the transaction with one
//! compare-and-swap on the claim's state word, as the model in
//! `proofs/tla/TxnCallbacks.tla` does:
//!
//! - `OPEN -> COMMITTING` is the owner starting its commit. After it nothing
//!   else aborts the transaction, and the owner alone runs its outcome.
//! - `OPEN -> ABORTED` is whoever ends the transaction without a commit: the
//!   owner by rollback or drop, or `close`. The winner runs the abort
//!   callbacks and the database hook; a loser runs neither.
//!
//! The `on_abort` callbacks live here, in a lock-free [`Handoff`]: the owner
//! pushes, and whoever ends the transaction takes the whole list once and runs
//! it, so each runs once however many threads reach for it. One registered
//! after the winner took the list stays in it, and the owner takes it at the
//! end of the transaction.
