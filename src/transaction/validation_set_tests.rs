/// The scanning transaction is drained as its commit drains it, so what

///   and buffers nothing;
/// * a content-addressed key the commit puts or merges is exempt, write
///   and read alike, and listed as exempt; one it only read, or deletes,
///   is validated for presence when a point read found it in the database
///   and in whole otherwise, a read its own delete answered included.
///
/// An optimistic transaction at `DefraLevel` that buffered nothing is
/// write-free: it keeps only the reads it made through `get_for_update`,
