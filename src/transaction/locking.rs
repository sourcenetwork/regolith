//! A pessimistic transaction's side of the lock table (`lock_table`): taking
//! a key's lock without waiting, or waiting for it up to the database's lock
//! timeout, and letting every lock go when the transaction ends or its commit
//! lands.
//!
//! Both kinds of call share one wait per key and transaction (a
//! `PendingLock`), kept in the transaction across calls. Publishing it is
//! one linearizable step of the transaction's wait map, so two calls that
//! find the lock taken at once never both queue a wait: the one that loses
//! gives its candidate's use back before the candidate could queue, and polls
//! the published wait instead (`LockTableCalls.tla`). A
//! [`try_get_for_update`](Transaction::try_get_for_update) that returned a
//! [`LockWait`] and runs again continues the same wait, with the losses it
//! counted toward the bypass bound, and so does a blocking call on the same
//! key. Each call records how it is to be told before it polls the wait (a
//! completion on its queue, or an unpark of its thread), so a wake that comes
//! while it polls is never missed.
