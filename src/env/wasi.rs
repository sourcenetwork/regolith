//! The [`Env`] for WASI: `wasm32-wasip1` and `wasm32-wasip2`.
//!
//! WASI is not a filesystem-less target. Given a host preopen
//! (`wasmtime run --dir=HOSTDIR::/data ...`) `std::fs` works, and it
//! was measured working here rather than assumed: create, open, read,
//! write, append after reopen, `set_len`, seek from the end, rename
//! over an existing entry, hard link, and `read_dir` all behave as
//! they do on Linux, and so does `File::sync_all`. regolith therefore runs
//! on real files on this target, not on an in-memory mirror.
//!
//! So `WasiEnv` delegates every filesystem call to [`StdEnv`] rather
//! than restating it, and states only what genuinely differs:
//!
//! - **No threads.** `std::thread::spawn` reports `Unsupported`
//!   (`os error 58`). [`WasiEnv::spawn`] returns that error with a
//!   message saying so, and [`Capabilities::threads`] is `false`.
//!   `Options::default()` already sets
//!   [`crate::Options::max_background_compactions`] to `0` on this
//!   target, so compaction runs on the calling thread and an open
//!   with stock options succeeds; a caller who raises that field
//!   anyway gets the explanation instead of a bare `Unsupported`
//!   raised several frames inside the compaction scheduler. That
//!   explanation is the main reason this type exists.
//! - **No directory fsync.** Opening a preopened directory and calling
//!   `sync_all` on it reports `EBADF`. [`Capabilities::sync_dir`] is
//!   `false` and regolith reports the narrower crash guarantee through
//!   [`crate::Db::capabilities`] instead of claiming one it does not
//!   provide. [`StdEnv`] already gets this right, because it derives
//!   the flag and the behavior from one expression rather than from
//!   `cfg!(unix)`, which is `false` here for unrelated reasons.
//! - **No file locking.** WASI has no `flock`, so the lock guard
//!   excludes nothing and creates no file. A create-exclusive `LOCK`
//!   file would be worse than nothing: a module that traps leaves it
//!   behind and every later open then fails permanently, blaming a
//!   second process that cannot exist on a host with one.
//! - **No page-cache hint.** There is no `posix_fadvise`, so
//!   [`WasiEnv::drop_page_cache`] does nothing at all rather than
//!   opening each compacted file to call a hint that is already a
//!   no-op on this target.
//!
//! # Positional reads
//!
//! `fd_pread` sits behind the unstable `wasi_ext` feature, so
//! [`StdEnv`]'s fallback seeks and reads under a lock. That lock is
//! uncontended by construction: this target has one thread.
