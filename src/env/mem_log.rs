//! The write-ahead log of [`super::MemEnv`]: a [`LogFile`] over a
//! [`MemFile`], with no lock.
//!
//! A `MemFile` grows at its end without a copy and nowhere else, so the log
//! keeps the file equal to the contiguous written prefix, as the serial log
//! does for an append-only host (`serial_log.rs`). What differs is that no
//! write waits for another:
//!
//! - **A write that starts at the file's end is appended there**, by a
//!   compare-and-swap that lands only while the file is still that long
//!   ([`MemFile::append_at`]). Two threads writing one record at once race
//!   for that append. The loser finds the file past its offset, and is
//!   done; or finds the winner still copying, takes the append over on a
//!   fresh extent, and the winner finds the file past its offset.
//! - **A write that starts above the end is held**: its bytes go into a
//!   lock-free map under their offset, and the call returns. The thread
//!   whose append reaches that offset appends them too.
//! - **A write that starts below the end** was written already (the
//!   contract makes its bytes the same) and is dropped.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - **ML1, the file holds exactly the contiguous written prefix**: every
//!   byte below its length, and nothing above it. A reader opened on the
//!   path sees a record once every record below it is written.
//! - **ML2, no held write that could be appended stays held.** A holder
//!   puts its bytes in the map and then looks at the file's end; an
//!   appender moves the end and then looks in the map. A fence sits between
//!   the two steps on each side, so one of them sees the other: the
//!   appender takes the bytes, or the holder finds the gap closed and
//!   appends them itself.
//! - **ML3, an entry of the map is of the record that starts at its key
//!   now.** A cut drops every entry at or above it, so no entry outlives a
//!   discarded commit to be appended in place of the one that takes its
//!   offset.
//! - **ML4, a write never waits for another thread** (see above).
//! - **ML5, bytes held are bounded by what the commit pipeline has in
//!   flight**: a write is held only while an earlier commit's write has
//!   not arrived. A holder that finds the file already past its offset (a
//!   thread writing the same record got there first) takes its own entry
//!   back out, so nothing that is written stays held.
