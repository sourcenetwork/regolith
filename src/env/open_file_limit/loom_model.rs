//! Loom models of the open-file slot table: acquire, evict and release.
//!
//! ```text
//! RUSTFLAGS="--cfg loom" cargo test --release --test loom_tables
//! ```
//!
//! Each model drives the production [`SlotTable`], whose state words, owner
//! words and descriptor cells come from `crate::sync::internal` and so are
//! loom's under `--cfg loom`. The descriptor is a [`ModelFile`] that knows
//! when it is being read and fails the model if it is closed (dropped) then,
//! or read after. What each proves:
//!
//! - **Never above the limit**: every model counts the descriptors alive at
//!   once and fails above the capacity.
//! - **Never closed in use**: a reader inside a read and a claimer evicting
//!   the same slot race; the claim waits for the read or takes another slot.
//! - **A reader reads its own file**: a reader joining from a stale hint
//!   races the slot being reloaded for another file; it reads its own bytes
//!   or misses, never the other file's.
//! - **A starved reader drains**: with one slot held by a reader, a second
//!   file's open waits for that read and then takes the slot.
//! - **A parked reopen is never forgotten** (D60): the unit a `CacheOnly`
//!   read queued runs its reopen without waiting while another thread's
//!   read holds the only slot, or loads it, and frees it. The unit parks or
//!   reads; once the slot is free, its queue holds the message that sends it
//!   back to run, and the run then reads. The production `Unit`,
//!   `QueueShared` and slot table are driven, the work standing in for
//!   `OpenFileLimit::hold` in a unit run.
//!
//! Each is paired with a calibration that plants one step wrong
//! ([`Mutant`]) and must fail.
