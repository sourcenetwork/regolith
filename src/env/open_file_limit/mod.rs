//! Bound how many SSTables hold an open file descriptor.
//!
//! A reader keeps its table's file open for as long as the table is
//! live, so a store needs one descriptor per live table. A large store,
//! or a process started with a low `RLIMIT_NOFILE` (256 under macOS
//! launchd), runs out, and every compaction then fails with EMFILE.
//!
//! [`OpenFileLimit`] wraps an [`Env`] and hands out SSTable files whose
//! descriptors live in a table of `capacity` slots ([`slots`]): it never
//! holds more than `capacity` descriptors, a read takes one by a single
//! compare-and-swap with no lock, and a descriptor is closed only when no
//! read is using it. Eviction is CLOCK: a read sets the slot's reference
//! bit, and the sweep that needs a slot skips a set bit (clearing it) and
//! takes the first slot that has none and no reader. Only SSTables are
//! managed; every other file passes through.
//!
//! A table's descriptor is reopened inside a device read, so a `CacheOnly`
//! handle never reopens one: its miss goes to its I/O queue as a unit, and
//! the unit's read, run by the polling thread, does the reopen. That reopen
//! never waits (D60): when every slot is in use by running reads, the unit
//! parks on its queue, and the read that frees a slot tells the queue. Only
//! a `Blocking` read, which chose to block, waits for one slot's running
//! reads to finish.
//!
//! # Removed tables
//!
//! Compaction removes a table as soon as no current version names it, and
//! older snapshots and iterators keep reading it. A closed descriptor could
//! not be reopened after an unlink, so [`Env::remove_file`] on a table that
//! still has a live handle renames the file aside instead, to a name
//! [`is_removed_table`] recognizes, and the last handle to go unlinks it.
//! Every descriptor therefore stays closable, which is what lets the bound
//! hold: there is no descriptor a removed table needs pinned open. A crash
//! leaves the renamed file behind; the next writable open sweeps it with the
//! other unreferenced tables (`engine::orphan_sweep`). A rename of a table
//! with live handles moves those handles to the new name the same way.
