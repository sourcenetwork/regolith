//! The host platform, behind one trait.
//!
//! The engine performs no `std::fs`, `std::thread`, or `std::time`
//! call of its own. Everything that touches the host goes through the
//! [`Env`] installed on [`crate::Options::env`], which defaults to
//! [`StdEnv`]: the same `std::fs` + `std::thread` + `std::time` calls
//! regolith made before this trait existed, in the same order, with the
//! same error kinds.
//!
//! # Why a trait object
//!
//! `Options` already carries `Arc<dyn CompactionFilter>`,
//! `Arc<dyn PrefixExtractor>`, `Arc<dyn MergeOperator>` and friends,
//! so `Arc<dyn Env>` extends the pattern that is already here rather
//! than introducing a generic parameter that would infect `Db`,
//! `Snapshot`, `Iter`, and every signature that mentions them. The
//! indirect call costs a few nanoseconds against a syscall that costs
//! hundreds, and the cached read path never reaches an `Env` at all:
//! a block-cache hit returns before any file is touched.
//!
//! # What a backend must decide
//!
//! Not every host has hard links, directory fsync, cross-process file
//! locking, or threads. [`Capabilities`] is how a backend says so and
//! how regolith reports it back through [`crate::Db::capabilities`],
//! rather than claiming a guarantee it is not providing.
//!
//! # Internal naming convention
//!
//! Engine constructors that touch the host take the `Env` as their
//! first argument and carry an `_in` suffix (`Wal::create_in`,
//! `SsTableReader::open_in`). The unsuffixed names remain as
//! `#[cfg(test)]` shims over [`std_env`] so the module-local unit
//! tests keep exercising the same code through the standard
//! environment.
