//! The bytes of one extent of a [`super::MemFile`]: a chain of segments that
//! an append in place lengthens, so a growing file never copies itself.
//!
//! An extent starts as one segment. An append in place that runs out of room
//! links one more segment at the end of the chain, as large as everything
//! before it (or as the append needs), while it holds `WRITER`, and before it
//! publishes the length that reaches into it. A file of `n` bytes is then
//! held in about `log2(n)` segments, written once each and never moved; a
//! copy (an overwrite, a shrink, a lost race) builds a new extent of one
//! segment.
//!
//! The room above the published length is left uninitialized: a write fills
//! what it publishes, and an extension zeroes what it exposes, so a file
//! holds in memory the bytes it has, not the room it grew into.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - Every segment that holds a byte below the published length was linked
//!   before that length was published (the link is a Release store, the
//!   publication a Release CAS, a reader's load of the length Acquire), so a
//!   reader that walks the chain below a length it loaded finds every link.
//! - Only the thread holding `WRITER` links a segment, and only at the end
//!   of the chain: a link is written once and never changed while the
//!   extent can be reached.
