//! Public streaming iterator over a consistent snapshot of the database.
//!
//! An [`Iter`] is obtained from [`Db::iter`](crate::Db::iter) or
//! [`Snapshot::iter`](crate::Snapshot::iter) and yields user keys in
//! ascending order. It honors MVCC snapshot visibility - keys written
//! after the iterator was created are invisible - and hides tombstoned
//! keys from the stream. The iterator is safe against concurrent
//! background compaction: it holds pinned references to every SSTable
//! file that existed at creation time, so compaction can unlink files
//! without invalidating in-flight reads.

/// Streaming iterator over a consistent view of the database.
///
/// Unlike [`Db::scan`](crate::Db::scan), which materializes an entire
/// result set at once, `Iter` yields entries on demand and bounds memory
/// by the size of a single block. Use [`Db::scan_page`](crate::Db::scan_page)
/// when a Vec-backed page is more convenient than manually driving the
/// iterator.
///
/// # Lifecycle
///
/// A fresh iterator is not positioned; call one of [`seek`](Self::seek),
/// [`seek_for_prev`](Self::seek_for_prev), or
/// [`seek_to_first`](Self::seek_to_first) before reading.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```no_run
/// use regolith::{Db, Options};
///
/// let db = Db::open("/tmp/regolith_iter", Options::default()).unwrap();
/// db.put(b"apple", b"red").unwrap();
/// db.put(b"banana", b"yellow").unwrap();
/// db.put(b"cherry", b"red").unwrap();
///
/// let mut it = db.iter();
/// it.seek(b"b");
/// while it.valid() {
///     println!("{:?} = {:?}", it.key(), it.value());
///     it.next();
/// }
/// ```
