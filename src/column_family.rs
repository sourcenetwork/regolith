//! Column families - multiple logically isolated keyspaces inside
//! one [`crate::Db`].
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Column families in regolith are implemented as **key-prefix
//! namespaces** on top of the single underlying LSM engine. Every
//! logical operation on a CF wraps the caller's user key in a
//! 4-byte big-endian `cf_id` prefix before handing it to the
//! engine. The engine sees one global keyspace; the logical
//! isolation is airtight because distinct `cf_id`s produce disjoint
//! byte ranges.
//!
//! ## Trade-offs vs per-CF memtables
//!
//! This design shares:
//!
//! - One memtable, one WAL, one manifest, one compaction thread.
//! - One block cache, one bloom / prefix-bloom budget.
//!
//! That means **cross-CF writes are atomic for free** (a
//! [`crate::WriteBatch`] touching multiple CFs lands in a single
//! underlying `apply_batch` call and crash-recovers as a unit), but
//! per-CF `write_buffer_size` / per-CF compaction strategies are
//! not available. The issue that introduced this feature explicitly
//! scopes those out of v1.
//!
//! ## Atomic flush across column families
//!
//! Because every CF shares one memtable, one WAL, and one
//! manifest, multi-CF writes are atomic in regolith by construction.
//! A flush produces one SSTable that either contains every key in
//! a batch or none of them; the WAL is the source of truth until
//! the manifest edit lands, so a crash mid-flush replays the
//! whole batch on reopen.
//!
//! [`crate::Options::atomic_flush`] is accepted for parity with
//! storage engines that require an explicit opt-in to get this
//! guarantee - under regolith's design its value is irrelevant, the
//! guarantee is always on.
//!
//! ## Metadata storage
//!
//! A reserved [`META_CF_ID`] = `0` holds CF registry entries:
//!
//! - `[0,0,0,0] || "next_id"` → `u32` big-endian counter (next id
//!   to hand out to a freshly created CF).
//! - `[0,0,0,0] || "name:" || <name>` → `u32` big-endian id of the
//!   CF with that name.
//!
//! Users cannot create a CF with id `0`; the default user-facing
//! CF is [`DEFAULT_CF_ID`] = `1` and is created lazily on first
//! [`crate::Db::open`] of a database that doesn't already contain
//! it. User keys in any CF cannot collide with metadata keys
//! because metadata lives under the reserved prefix `[0,0,0,0]`,
//! which no user-facing CF ever produces.
//!
//! ## Dropping a CF
//!
//! [`crate::Db::drop_column_family`] issues a `delete_range` over
//! the CF's prefix range and then removes the `name:` and the
//! handle's lookups. The range delete is O(1) write work regardless
//! of how many keys the CF contained; space is reclaimed on the
//! next compaction over the range. Dropped CFs leave no trace on
//! reopen.
//!
//! ## Creating and dropping against concurrent writes
//!
//! A create or a drop commits as a write group of its own, and the
//! registry changes inside that same ordered step, right after the
//! group is durable and applied. Every write checks the families it
//! touches in the ordered step too, before it takes a sequence. So a
//! write racing a drop either takes a sequence below the drop's range
//! tombstone, which then deletes it, or is refused with
//! [`crate::Error::InvalidColumnFamily`]: it never lands in a family
//! that is already dropped, and never reports success for bytes no
//! handle can read. The registry itself takes no lock: liveness is one
//! lookup in a lock-free map.
