//! A small number for the calling thread, so state that every thread
//! updates can be split into one cache line per thread.
//!
//! [`index`] gives the calling thread a number below [`width`]. The first
//! call on a thread claims the lowest free number from a fixed pool with
//! one compare-and-swap and keeps it in a thread-local; every later call is
//! one thread-local read, with no system call and no shared write. A thread
//! that exits gives its number back, so a pool of short-lived threads keeps
//! reusing the low numbers instead of spreading over the whole range.
//!
//! The pool holds [`width`] numbers: the machine's parallelism rounded up
//! to a power of two, capped at [`MAX_WIDTH`]. A thread that finds every
//! number taken shares one, picked round robin, and never gives it back.
//!
//! # What a number promises
//!
//! Only "probably nobody else is using this right now". Everything indexed
//! by these numbers (the snapshot registry's slots, the statistics shards)
//! is updated with atomic read-modify-writes and stays exact when several
//! threads share a number; sharing costs contention, never correctness.
//! That is also why a number may be reused while a handle created under it
//! is still alive on another thread: the handle records where it is
//! announced and releases exactly there.
//!
//! On a target with one thread (wasm without the `atomics` feature) the
//! width is 1 and every call returns 0.
//!
//! Under `--cfg loom` [`index`] is always 0: loom's models place state in
//! chosen numbers themselves and check [`IndexPool`] directly.
