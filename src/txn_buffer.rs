//! The buffer a transaction accumulates its own keys in.
//!
//! Buffering takes `&self` so one transaction can be shared across
//! threads, which rules out a plain `BTreeMap`. A general concurrent map
//! is the obvious substitute and the wrong one here: it allocates a table
//! the moment it exists, and a transaction holds three of these buffers
//! and lives for microseconds. Measured on the transaction benchmark,
//! paying for those tables cost 61% to 67% of uncontended commit
//! throughput.
//!
//! This is sized for what a transaction actually holds. It allocates
//! nothing until the first entry, then one node per entry, and answers a
//! lookup by walking the list. A transaction touching a handful of keys
//! beats a hash table on both counts. Past
//! [`crate::Options::transaction_keys_inline`] entries the walk would stop
//! being cheap, so the buffer indexes itself with a `HopscotchMap`.
//!
//! The index holds pointers into the list, not copies of what the list
//! holds. Copying would put a second key and a second value on the heap
//! for every entry, which on a large transaction is the memory the caller
//! was trying not to spend.
//!
//! # Why the reclamation problem does not arise
//!
//! Nodes are never unlinked. An overwrite prepends, and the walk returns
//! the first match, so the newest value for a key is the one found. The
//! list is freed only in `Drop`, which takes `&mut self` and therefore
//! cannot run beside a reader. That is what makes a plain `AtomicPtr`
//! list sound here without epochs or hazard pointers, and it is a
//! property of how a transaction is used rather than of this type: it
//! holds because a transaction is resolved exclusively.
