//! ACID transactions on top of [`crate::Db`].
//!
//! Two flavors:
//!
//! - [`OptimisticTransactionDb`]: transactions take no locks,
//!   buffer writes in memory, and detect write-write conflicts at
//!   commit time by re-checking the visible seq of each touched key
//!   against the snapshot seq the transaction was anchored at.
//!   Best for low-contention workloads where most transactions
//!   commit on the first try.
//!
//! - [`TransactionDb`]: transactions acquire exclusive key locks
//!   as they write (or as [`Transaction::get_for_update`] is called)
//!   and hold them until commit / rollback. Contention is resolved
//!   when the lock is taken rather than at commit, and a
//!   timeout-based deadlock defense returns [`TransactionError::Busy`]
//!   when a lock cannot be acquired in time. Best for workloads
//!   where contention is high and retry cost dominates.
//!
//! Both flavors share a single [`Transaction`] type. The type
//! carries the mode internally so user code can write helpers that
//! work against either db.
//!
//! # Isolation level
//!
//! Both flavors provide **snapshot isolation** and both prevent
//! lost updates, but they anchor their reads at different points.
//!
//! An optimistic transaction reads everything as of the engine seq
//! captured at begin. A pessimistic transaction reads a key it has
//! not locked at that same begin seq, and reads a key it locks
//! through [`Transaction::get_for_update`] as of the moment the
//! lock was acquired. The lock handoff orders it after every
//! transaction that committed while it waited, so a
//! read-modify-write through `get_for_update` sees the value the
//! previous lock holder committed instead of a stale one. Reads
//! that hit the transaction's own buffered writes always see the
//! written value. A read anchor only ever moves forward, so two
//! reads of the same key inside one transaction never travel
//! backwards in time.
//!
//! At commit each flavor validates a set of keys, every key against
//! the *earliest* sequence this transaction observed it at:
//!
//! - Optimistic: every key the transaction wrote or read through
//!   `get_for_update`, against the begin snapshot.
//! - Pessimistic: every key the transaction read and then wrote
//!   (the read-modify-write set) plus every key it read through
//!   `get_for_update`. A key written blind, without ever being
//!   read, is not validated: there is no read to invalidate, and the
//!   key lock already orders it against every other transaction.
//!
//! For a pessimistic transaction the check cannot fire while every
//! writer goes through the lock manager. It fires when a key the
//! transaction read was written around the lock manager (for example
//! through [`TransactionDb::db`]) or before the lock was taken,
//! which surfaces as [`TransactionError::Conflict`] rather than as
//! a lost update.
//!
//! Rolling back to a savepoint discards buffered writes; it does not
//! discard what the transaction has already read, so a read anchor
//! survives the rollback and still guards the commit.
//!
//! Serializable isolation is out of scope for v1: reads that are
//! never written are not validated, so a read-only key can change
//! underneath a transaction without aborting it.
//!
//! # Out of scope (follow-ups)
//!
//! - Range-scan conflict tracking (only point writes / `get_for_update`
//!   participate in conflict detection).
//! - Transactional range deletes. [`Transaction::delete_range`] rejects
//!   non-empty ranges until range conflict tracking or range locks land.
//! - Wait-for graph deadlock detection (the pessimistic flavor ships
//!   with timeout-based detection only).
//! - Column-family-aware transactions (depends on CFs landing).
//! - Streaming iteration over a transaction's buffered-plus-snapshot
//!   view (`Transaction::iter` is not implemented; callers can
//!   commit then iterate, or use point lookups).
