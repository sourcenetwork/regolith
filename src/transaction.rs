//! ACID transactions on top of [`crate::Db`].
//!
//! Two flavors:
//!
//! - [`OptimisticTransactionDb`]: transactions take no locks,
//!   buffer writes in memory, and detect write-write conflicts at
//!   commit time by re-checking the visible seq of each touched key
//!   against the snapshot seq the transaction was anchored at.
//!   Best for low-contention workloads where most transactions
//!   commit on the first try.
//!
//! - [`TransactionDb`]: transactions acquire exclusive key locks
//!   as they write (or as [`Transaction::get_for_update`] is called)
//!   and hold them until commit / rollback. Contention is resolved
//!   when the lock is taken rather than at commit, and a
//!   timeout-based deadlock defense returns [`TransactionError::Busy`]
//!   when a lock cannot be acquired in time.
//!   [`Transaction::try_get_for_update`] never waits: it returns a
//!   [`LockWait`](crate::LockWait) instead. Best for workloads
//!   where contention is high and retry cost dominates.
//!
//! Both flavors share a single [`Transaction`] type. The type
//! carries the mode internally so user code can write helpers that
//! work against either db.
//!
//! # Isolation level
//!
//! A transaction runs at the [`IsolationLevel`] it is begun with, which
//! defaults to snapshot isolation. At every level it reads from a snapshot,
//! and at snapshot isolation and above both flavors prevent lost updates.
//! The two anchor their reads at different points.
//!
//! An optimistic transaction reads everything as of the engine seq
//! captured at begin. A pessimistic transaction reads a key it has
//! not locked at that same begin seq, and reads a key it locks
//! through [`Transaction::get_for_update`] as of the moment the
//! lock was acquired. The lock handoff orders it after every
//! transaction that committed while it waited, so a
//! read-modify-write through `get_for_update` sees the value the
//! previous lock holder committed instead of a stale one. Reads
//! that hit the transaction's own buffered writes always see the
//! written value, and a key the transaction merged into reads as the
//! merge operator folds its operands, in the order it made them, onto
//! the value it last put or deleted the key to, or else onto the
//! value it reads for the key. A read anchor only ever moves forward,
//! so two reads of the same key inside one transaction never travel
//! backwards in time.
//!
//! At commit each flavor validates a set of keys, every key against
//! the *earliest* sequence this transaction observed it at:
//!
//! - Optimistic: every key the transaction wrote or read through
//!   `get_for_update`, against the begin snapshot. At
//!   [`IsolationLevel::DefraLevel`], a key the transaction only merges into
//!   conflicts with a newer put, delete or range delete of the key, and not
//!   with a newer merge operand.
//! - Pessimistic: every key the transaction read and then wrote
//!   (the read-modify-write set) plus every key it read through
//!   `get_for_update`. A key written blind, without ever being
//!   read, is not validated: there is no read to invalidate, and the
//!   key lock already orders it against every other transaction.
//!
//! For a pessimistic transaction the check cannot fire while every
//! writer goes through the lock manager. It fires when a key the
//! transaction read was written around the lock manager (for example
//! through [`TransactionDb::db`]) or before the lock was taken,
//! which surfaces as [`TransactionError::Conflict`] rather than as
//! a lost update.
//!
//! Rolling back to a savepoint discards buffered writes; it does not
//! discard what the transaction has already read, so a read anchor
//! survives the rollback and still guards the commit. A savepoint is a
//! mark on the write buffer's entry count, so setting one is O(1) and
//! rolling back costs the writes it discards.
//!
//! Below [`IsolationLevel::RepeatableRead`] a plain read ([`Transaction::get`],
//! [`Transaction::get_slice`] or a transactional scan) of a key the
//! transaction never writes is not validated; at
//! [`IsolationLevel::SnapshotIsolation`] a [`Transaction::get_for_update`]
//! key is validated even when it is not written. At `RepeatableRead` every key a
//! point read returned is validated and a scanned key still is not; at
//! `Serializable` every key read by any of them is. At every level, a key a
//! transactional scan walked that the transaction then writes is validated
//! as a read from the begin snapshot, so a scan-then-write is never taken
//! for a blind write. One exception is a stretch that stays inside one
//! [`KeyClass::CommutativePrefix`] at [`IsolationLevel::DefraLevel`] with a
//! [`KeyClassifier`] installed: a write there is validated as a blind write.
//! The other is a key that classifier declares [`KeyClass::ContentAddressed`]:
//! at that level a put or merge of it is not validated, a read of it that
//! found a value is validated for its presence only, and a delete of it, or a
//! read that found nothing, is validated as for any key.
//!
//! # Callbacks
//!
//! [`Transaction::before_commit`], [`Transaction::on_commit`] and
//! [`Transaction::on_abort`] attach code to one transaction, and
//! [`TransactionHooks`] (through [`crate::Options::transaction_hooks`]) to
//! every transaction of a database, at every isolation level. Exactly one of
//! `on_commit` and `on_abort` runs for each transaction, once per callback,
//! whichever way it ends. The rules are on [`TransactionHooks`] and on each
//! method.
//!
//! # A constant write is not a claim
//!
//! A write of exactly the bytes the key holds at commit is not a conflict
//! (identical-write elision), because the schedule has a serial order that
//! reaches the same state. So two optimistic transactions that each put the
//! same constant under a key neither read both commit: writing a sentinel
//! does not claim the key.
//!
//! To claim a key, read it with [`Transaction::get_for_update`] first. At
//! commit that read is validated, so the later committer conflicts; under a
//! pessimistic transaction the read is taken under the key's lock and sees
//! what the earlier holder committed. An optimistic transaction can also write
//! a value unique to the writer, such as its own id: the later committer's
//! bytes then differ from the committed ones and it conflicts.
//!
//! # Limits
//!
//! - A plain scan does not detect phantoms. It records the stretches of keys
//!   it walked only to anchor keys the commit validates anyway, so a key
//!   another transaction inserts into the range after the snapshot is
//!   detected only when this transaction also writes it or validates it as a
//!   point read at its level. A scan whose result decides something is a
//!   [`Transaction::cursor`] with [`ScanCheck::Range`]: any write inside the
//!   range it covered since the snapshot is a conflict, at every level.
//! - [`Transaction::delete_range`] refuses a non-empty range: a range delete
//!   takes no part in conflict detection or in key locking.
//! - A deadlock between pessimistic transactions is found by the lock
//!   timeout ([`TransactionError::Busy`]) and not sooner: no wait-for graph
//!   is kept.
//! - A transaction reads and writes the default column family only. The
//!   other families are reached through [`Db`]'s `*_cf` methods, outside any
//!   transaction.

/// | Level | Dirty read | Non-repeatable read | Lost update | Write skew |
/// |---|---|---|---|---|
/// | [`IsolationLevel::ReadCommitted`] | no | possible | possible | possible |

/// | [`IsolationLevel::RepeatableRead`] | no | no | no | **through a scan** |

///
/// The [`IsolationLevel::DefraLevel`] row is `RepeatableRead`'s, with the
/// relaxations described on that variant. A key that is only merged into is
/// not snapshot isolated there: concurrent transactions can all commit a
/// merge to it, and every operand applies. When every transaction uses only
/// point reads, puts, deletes and merges, the committed transactions are
/// serializable in commit order. The keys a scan returns are not validated.
/// A key the installed classifier declares [`KeyClass::ContentAddressed`] is
/// outside that statement: transactions that create it all commit, and a read
/// that found it holds as long as the key is not deleted.
///
/// Every level reads from a snapshot captured when the transaction
/// began, so none of them can observe a dirty read. What changes is the
/// size of the read set validated at commit.
///
/// # Where RepeatableRead sits
///
/// [`IsolationLevel::RepeatableRead`] validates every key a point read
/// returned, as `Serializable` does, and records a scan as
/// `SnapshotIsolation` does: one entry per stretch it walked, none per key
/// it yielded. A point read therefore refuses write skew and a scan does
/// not: two transactions that each scan what the other writes both commit.
/// In Adya's terms it is PL-2.99, the formal repeatable read, on top of
/// PL-SI: G1, G-SI and G2-item are forbidden, and an anti-dependency
/// through a predicate read (a key a scan yielded, or a phantom) is
/// allowed. It is the level for a scan whose result is allowed to change
/// underneath the transaction by construction, a set of markers that
/// concurrent writers only ever add to or reclaim, where an entry per key
/// would cost commit time and abort transactions no serial order needed
/// to abort.
///
/// This is the contract both [`OptimisticTransactionDb`] and
/// [`TransactionDb`] run.
///
/// # Why write skew survives snapshot isolation
///
/// Under [`IsolationLevel::SnapshotIsolation`] a key is validated only
/// if the transaction wrote it, or read it through
/// [`Transaction::get_for_update`]. Two transactions can therefore each
/// read what the other is about to overwrite, write disjoint keys, and
/// both commit - a schedule no serial order produces. Elle reports it as
/// a G2 anti-dependency cycle.
///
/// [`IsolationLevel::Serializable`] validates *every* key the
/// transaction read. A concurrent commit to any of them aborts it, so
/// the anti-dependency edge that would close the cycle cannot form.
/// This is backward validation: the cost is paid by the transaction
/// committing second, and it is proportional to its read set.
///
/// # The one thing to know before relying on it
///
/// Serializability here is validation of a set of keys, not of a
/// predicate. Point reads and every key a transactional scan yields are
/// in that set. The stretches a scan walked are recorded too, but only to
/// anchor keys the transaction validates anyway: a phantom - a key that
/// did not exist to be yielded, inserted into the range by a concurrent
/// transaction - aborts the transaction only if it also writes that key or
/// point-reads it. A transaction whose correctness depends on the absence
/// of keys in a range must not rely on this level for it: it scans the
/// range through [`Transaction::cursor`] with [`ScanCheck::Range`], which
/// validates the range itself, at this level and every other.
/// [`Transaction::delete_range`] stays rejected.
///
/// # What a scan costs at Serializable
///
/// A transactional scan at [`IsolationLevel::Serializable`] adds one
/// read-set entry per key it yields, held until the transaction resolves,
/// and the commit checks them in two passes. The first runs on the
/// committing thread before the commit enters the pipeline, against
/// everything committed by then, and holds up nobody. The second runs when
/// the commit's turn in the pipeline comes, for what was committed in
/// between: one lookup of each key's newest version, in the memtables alone
/// unless a flush or an ingest landed since the first pass. The commits and
/// plain writes behind it in the pipeline, [`crate::Db::put`] included, are
/// decided only after that second pass, so a large scan delays every writer
/// by one lookup per scanned key. A transaction that writes nothing does not
/// enter the pipeline: its commit checks every entry once, on the committing
/// thread, and holds up no writer. Below this level a scan records one entry
/// per stretch of keys it walked, not one per key.
///
/// # A write-free reader needs writers that validate their reads
///
/// At [`IsolationLevel::DefraLevel`] an optimistic transaction that writes
/// nothing validates none of its plain reads: it read one snapshot, so what
/// it saw is a state the database was in. That state lies on a serial order
/// of the committed transactions only when every transaction that writes
/// to the database validates the reads its writes depend on: its point
/// reads at `RepeatableRead`, `Serializable` and `DefraLevel`, and a scan
/// it decides on through [`ScanCheck::Range`]. A writer at
/// [`IsolationLevel::SnapshotIsolation`], the default, or at
/// `ReadCommitted`, commits on reads nobody checked, and a reader can then
/// see a state no serial order passes through, whatever level the reader
/// runs at. Give the writers a validating level when a write-free reader's
/// result must be one a serial order could have produced.
///
/// A reader at `RepeatableRead` or `Serializable` checks every read at its
/// commit, against every commit decided by then, published or not, so one
/// that commits after the writer whose input it missed is refused: the
/// report below, made at `Serializable` and committed after the withdrawal,
/// conflicts on `checking`. One that commits first cannot be refused, since
/// the write it missed is not there yet; only the writers' level prevents
/// that.
///
/// The example, the same one the TLA+ model (`RepeatableRead.tla`), the Lean
/// proof (`read_only_anomaly`) and the tests use. A checking account holds
/// 30 and a savings account 0. A withdrawal reads both and takes 25 from
