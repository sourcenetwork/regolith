//! The atomics, locks and gates the engine builds on.
//!
//! Everything here has two implementations selected by `cfg(loom)`. A
//! normal build takes `std::sync`; a `--cfg loom` build takes
//! `loom::sync`, whose instrumented mocks are the only accesses loom
//! can see. A `std::sync::atomic::AtomicPtr` is invisible to the model
//! checker, so anything that wants to be model-checked imports from
//! here rather than from `std` directly: the arena, the skip list, the
//! memtable, the read horizon and the commit pipeline all do.
//!
//! The loom mocks are only usable inside a `loom::model` call, so
//! `cfg(loom)` is a model-checking build and nothing else.
//!
//! # Why the wrappers exist
//!
//! [`Mutex`] and [`RwLock`] are thin newtypes rather than re-exports
//! because `std` poisons a lock whose holder panicked and hands back a
//! `LockResult`, while the engine has no use for poisoning: a panic in
//! one thread must not convert every later lock acquisition in every
//! other thread into a second panic, which is how a single failing
//! assertion turns into a torn shutdown. Each wrapper recovers the
//! guard with [`std::sync::PoisonError::into_inner`] and hands it back
//! directly, so a caller sees the lock's contents exactly as the
//! panicking thread left them and deals with it as ordinary state.
//!
//! [`Gate`] is the third primitive and the only one with no `std`
//! counterpart: a reader-writer gate whose exclusive guard owns its
//! claim instead of borrowing the gate, so it can outlive the call that
//! took it. `checkpoint_capture` needs exactly that, returning a
//! snapshot that pins every referenced SSTable against a concurrent
//! unlink for as long as the caller holds it.
//!
//! [`UnsafeCell`] and [`SingleWriterGuard`] live here for the same reason
//! as everything else: a `std::cell::UnsafeCell` is invisible to loom, so
//! state that is mutated without a lock (the arena's chunk list, A8 in
//! `engine::arena`) goes through the wrapper here instead, and the debug
//! guard that catches a broken single-writer contract is shared by the
//! arena and the skip list rather than duplicated between them.
