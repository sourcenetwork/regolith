//! Lifecycle event callbacks for flush, compaction, and ingest.
//!
//! Callers register one or more [`EventListener`] implementations via
//! [`crate::Options::listeners`] to react to engine lifecycle events.
//! Typical uses: metrics pipelines (emit a span per flush), debugging
//! (log which files compaction picked), test harnesses (wait on a
//! callback instead of sleeping), and operational triggers (upload
//! the freshly-flushed SSTable to object storage).
//!
//! # Dispatch
//!
//! Events are dispatched **synchronously** on the thread that
//! triggered them - flush events on the thread that ran the flush (a
//! writer, or an ingest writing out the memtables that filled while it
//! ran), compaction events on the compaction thread, ingest events on
//! the ingest caller's thread. Listeners **MUST NOT block** or re-enter
//! the database. The contract is "do a cheap thing or spawn a task."
//! Blocking inside a listener stalls the engine and will starve
//! background compaction / flush pipelines.
//!
//! # Non-guarantees
//!
//! - Listener order is unspecified. Multiple listeners registered
//!   in the same `Options::listeners` vector see events in vector
//!   order, but a caller that cares about sequencing should own
//!   its own fan-out.
//! - Per-column-family filtering is out of scope. A listener sees
//!   every event from every CF; callers that only care about a
//!   subset should filter in the callback.
//! - `on_wal_full` is declared so listener implementations can
//!   target a common shape across storage backends, but regolith
//!   itself never fires it - the WAL is rotated alongside every
//!   memtable, so there's no separate "WAL-full" condition.
