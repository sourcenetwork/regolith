//! What landed for one queue, as its owner keeps it, and when it lets each
//! landing go.
//!
//! A read run again after a wait finds its block in the block cache or in
//! what landed for its queue (`QueueShared::landed`). That table is bounded
//! by the queue's bytes: past the bound the oldest landings go. A call that
//! needs several blocks at once (a `multi_get`, a collecting scan, a read
//! merging operands from several tables) starts over each time it is run,
//! so evicting the blocks it found on its earlier runs could keep it from
//! ever finishing: two blocks that each take most of the bound would evict
//! each other on every run.
//!
//! So a landing a call still needs is held, and only the others count
//! against the bound:
//!
//! - a wait carries the landed blocks its call read before it
//!   ([`WaitSlot::holds`]): they are held while the wait is pending;
//! - once the wait completes it is *kept*: its holds, and the block it waited
//!   for, stay held until the call is seen again: a later wait whose holds
//!   cover them (the call was run again and waits for one more block), or a
//!   call that read all of them and finished ([`Message::Finished`]);
//! - abandoned waits expire after [`KEEP_ROUNDS`] landing polls; a live
//!   caller retains progress for at most [`LIVE_KEEP_ROUNDS`] landing polls.
//!   A forgotten handle cannot pin landings forever.
//!
//! The landings no call holds go oldest first, at the end of a poll, until
//! total bytes fit the bound or only held landings remain. Total bytes
//! can exceed the bound by the
//! union of blocks held by pending and retained calls; this is not a hard
//! total-memory bound. Completed live waits have a finite age bound, not a
//! separate byte cap. A caller resuming within that window finds its progress;
//! after expiry it may need to reread. IoProgress reports completed live
//! retention bytes, with a warning once per episode above half the bound.
//! `proofs/tla/LandingHold.tla` checks that such a call finishes, and that
//! the eviction this replaces (oldest first, holding nothing) never lets it.
