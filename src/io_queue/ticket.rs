/// The outcome of a [`Transaction::commit_nowait`](crate::Transaction::commit_nowait).
///
/// Ready once the commit is visible, and durable when its durability is
/// [`Immediate`](crate::DurabilityMode::Immediate), or with the reason it
/// did not commit: a conflict, a failed log write, `Closed`. Every outcome
/// comes through the ticket, a conflict included.
///
/// - **Where it completes.** A commit on a transaction with an
///   [`IoQueue`](crate::IoQueue) (named by
///   [`TxnOptions::io_queue`](crate::TxnOptions::io_queue), or by its
///   [`ReadMode::CacheOnly`](crate::ReadMode::CacheOnly)) whose outcome is
///   still owed an fsync when `commit_nowait` returns is completed on that
///   queue: at the [`IoQueue::poll`](crate::IoQueue::poll) that takes the
///   completion in, on the thread that owns the queue, and nowhere else. A
///   task awaiting the ticket is woken by that poll only. A commit whose
///   outcome is known when `commit_nowait` returns (a conflict, an
///   `Eventual` commit, a transaction with no queue, which syncs inline)
///   returns a ticket that is ready already.
/// - **Callbacks.** The transaction's own `on_commit` or `on_abort`
///   callbacks, then the database's hooks, then each [`on_complete`](Self::on_complete)
///   callback run once, on the thread that delivers the outcome (the queue's
///   owner at that poll, or the committing thread for a ticket ready at
///   return), in that order.
/// - **Dropping** a ticket never cancels the commit: it is decided and
///   written before the ticket exists, and its callbacks still run when the
///   queue delivers it. Dropping the queue instead delivers every ticket it
///   holds on the dropping thread (see [`IoQueue`](crate::IoQueue)).
///
/// It is a [`Future`] whose output is the commit's outcome; awaiting it again
/// after it was ready returns a copy of the same outcome.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicU64, Ordering};
///
/// use regolith::{IoBudget, OptimisticTransactionDb, Options, TxnOptions};
///
/// let db = OptimisticTransactionDb::open("rows", Options::memory())?;
/// let mut queue = db.db().io_queue();
/// let on_queue = TxnOptions::new().io_queue(queue.id());
///
/// let txn = db.begin(&on_queue);
/// txn.put(b"row", b"1")?;
/// let ticket = txn.commit_nowait();
///
/// // The callback gets the outcome once: at the poll that delivers it, or
/// // at once when the ticket is ready already, as it is on this in-memory
/// // database, which has no sync to wait for.
/// let delivered = Arc::new(AtomicU64::new(0));
/// let seen = Arc::clone(&delivered);
/// ticket.on_complete(move |outcome| {
///     if let Ok(receipt) = outcome {
///         seen.store(receipt.seq(), Ordering::Relaxed);
///     }
/// });
///
/// // The queue's owner polls it when it has nothing else to run. On a
/// // durable database the poll that takes the outcome in completes the
/// // ticket.
/// while !ticket.is_ready() {
///     queue.poll(IoBudget::ALL);
/// }
/// let receipt = queue.block_on(ticket)?;
/// assert_eq!(delivered.load(Ordering::Relaxed), receipt.seq());
///
/// // Dropping a ticket cancels nothing: the commit is already decided.
/// let txn = db.begin(&on_queue);
/// txn.put(b"row", b"2")?;
/// drop(txn.commit_nowait());
/// queue.poll(IoBudget::ALL);
/// assert_eq!(db.db().get(b"row")?.as_deref(), Some(&b"2"[..]));
