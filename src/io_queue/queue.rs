/// two threads cannot poll it at once. Handles name it by [`IoQueue::id`] in
/// [`ReadMode::CacheOnly`](crate::ReadMode::CacheOnly); a read through such a
/// handle may run on any thread, and its miss is recorded here all the same.
///
/// [`poll`](Self::poll) runs the reads and jobs this thread waits on and
/// delivers the completions other threads pushed. Every completion of work
/// recorded here arrives here and nowhere else, and wakes only the waits
/// recorded here: a read's [`IoWait`](crate::IoWait), a commit's
/// [`CommitTicket`](crate::CommitTicket), a stall's
/// [`StallWait`](crate::StallWait), a job's [`JobTicket`](crate::JobTicket).
/// A thread with nothing to run registers [`idle_waker`](Self::idle_waker)
/// and idles; the next completion pushed to it wakes it, once.
///
/// A timed wait is the one thing no other thread completes: it is over at
/// the first poll that finds the database's clock at its due time. Each
/// poll says how long until the earliest one
/// ([`IoProgress::wake_in`](crate::IoProgress::wake_in)), and an owner that
/// idles polls again by then. A queue that holds none reads no clock.
///
/// The queue is its thread's for the I/O regolith starts itself on that
/// thread's calls: made on a thread, or polled on one, it takes that
/// thread's owed steps, stalls and foreground jobs. A thread with no queue
/// open runs that I/O inline, bounded.
///
/// What a queue owes is bounded by bytes: once the reads it waits on reach
/// the bound (a few hundred blocks of the database's block size), a further
/// miss waits for room instead of adding a read, and records its read when it
/// is run again. One read larger than the bound is still admitted when the
/// queue owes nothing else.
///
/// Dropping the queue completes every wait recorded on it, on the dropping
/// thread; a read run again through a handle that still names it fails with
/// [`Error::InvalidArgument`](crate::Error::InvalidArgument). A read the
/// queue had not finished is closed, and any other queue waiting on it runs
/// its own read again. A commit's fsync the queue waits on is run here if
/// nobody runs it yet, and waited for if another thread does, so every
/// ticket on the queue still gets its true outcome and every callback on it
/// still runs exactly once. A job the queue owns alone is settled without
/// running: the step a write left owing is owed again, and a foreground
/// job's ticket fails, saying the queue that would have run it is gone.
