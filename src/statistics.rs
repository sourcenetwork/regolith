//! Engine-wide counters and histograms for observability.
//!
//! A caller configures [`crate::Options::statistics`] with an
//! [`Arc<Statistics>`] and the engine increments tickers and
//! records histograms on every hot path it has instrumented. The
//! caller then polls the `Statistics` object (via
//! [`Statistics::get_ticker`], [`Statistics::get_histogram_snapshot`],
//! or [`Statistics::to_string`]) to export the values to their
//! monitoring stack of choice.
//!
//! # Cost when disabled
//!
//! `Options::statistics = None` short-circuits every instrumentation
//! site behind an `Option::is_some` check plus an `Arc` clone at
//! open time. The hot-path overhead is a single branch. Reaching
//! for a non-`None` statistics object adds one `fetch_add` per
//! ticker update and a short mutex for histogram updates.
//!
//! # Histograms
//!
//! The initial histogram implementation tracks `count`, `sum`,
//! `min`, and `max` only. `HistogramSnapshot::average` gives you
//! `sum / count`. Percentiles / buckets are intentionally out of
//! scope for v1 - adding an HDR-style bucket array is a follow-up
//! that drops in behind the existing API without breaking
//! callers.
