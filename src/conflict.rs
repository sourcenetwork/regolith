//! Why a commit lost a race.
//!
//! A [`Conflict`] names what the losing transaction did with a key
//! ([`Access`]), what the newer committed write was ([`WriteKind`]) and the two
//! sequences involved. It is built only when a commit actually conflicts, so a
//! commit that wins pays nothing for it.
//!
//! A key can hold user data, so neither `Display` nor `Debug` of a
//! [`Conflict`] prints its bytes: both print the key's length and a short
//! hash, which is enough to tell whether two conflicts are on the same key.
