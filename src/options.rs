    ///   [`Options::max_write_buffer_number`] is 2, so at most one
    ///   active plus one frozen memtable is resident. Skip-list node
    ///   overhead sits on top of the entry bytes, so budget more than
    ///   512 KiB for this term, not exactly 512 KiB.
    /// - **Block cache, exactly 0 bytes.**
    ///   [`Options::block_cache_size`] of 0 allocates no shard at all,
    ///   retains no block, and leaves the cache tickers at zero. A
    ///   host with an OS page cache absorbs the resulting re-reads;
    ///   a wasm module serves them out of bytes it already holds.
    ///   Raise it to 256 KiB if the budget is nearer 4 MiB than 1 MiB.
    /// - **Per-SSTable metadata, linear in the number of open files.**
    ///   Each open SSTable holds its index block and Bloom filter
    ///   resident. With a 256 KiB [`Options::target_file_size`], a
    ///   4 KiB [`Options::block_size`], and 10
    ///   [`Options::bloom_bits_per_key`], that is roughly 4-6 KiB per
    ///   file, so about 0.25 MiB for a 16 MiB database. This term is
    ///   the one that grows without bound as the database grows; see
    ///   the note on [`Options::partitioned_index`] below.
    /// - **Transient flush and compaction buffers**, bounded by
    ///   [`Options::target_file_size`] and [`Options::block_size`]
    ///   rather than by the size of the level being merged.
    ///
    /// # Every value, and what it buys
    ///
    /// - [`Options::write_buffer_size`] `256 KiB`: the largest
    ///   steady-state allocation, and the bound on how much WAL
    ///   accumulates between rotations.
    /// - [`Options::max_write_buffer_number`] `2`: caps in-memory
    ///   entry bytes at two write buffers.
    /// - [`Options::block_size`] `4 KiB`: matches LittleFS and SPIFFS
    ///   page granularity, and caps the transient decompression buffer
    ///   for an uncached read at 4 KiB instead of the default 16 KiB.
    ///   That transient matters more here precisely because there is
    ///   no block cache to amortize it.
    /// - [`Options::block_cache_size`] `0` and
    ///   [`Options::block_cache_num_shard_bits`] `0`: no cache, and
    ///   the shard count pinned so that raising the budget later does
    ///   not silently allocate 64 shards.
    /// - [`Options::target_file_size`] `256 KiB`: bounds one
    ///   compaction output file, and keeps compaction holding a block
    ///   at a time rather than a file at a time.
    /// - [`Options::level_base_bytes`] `1 MiB` with
    ///   [`Options::level_size_multiplier`] `10`: L1 1 MiB, L2 10 MiB,
    ///   L3 100 MiB - a shape suited to flash measured in tens of MiB.
    /// - [`Options::l0_compaction_trigger`] `2`,
    ///   [`Options::level0_slowdown_writes_trigger`] `4`,
    ///   [`Options::level0_stop_writes_trigger`] `8`: compact early
    ///   and often. A writer that compacts on its own thread should
    ///   pay in small installments rather than take one long stall,
    ///   and a low L0 count also caps how many files a point lookup
    ///   has to consult.
    /// - [`Options::soft_pending_compaction_bytes_limit`] `4 MiB` and
    ///   [`Options::hard_pending_compaction_bytes_limit`] `16 MiB`:
    ///   the byte-denominated back-pressure, scaled to flash rather
    ///   than to the default's 64 GiB / 256 GiB.
    /// - [`Options::max_background_compactions`] `0`: compaction runs
    ///   on the calling thread. Required on a single-threaded host;
    ///   on a board with a spare core, set this to `1`.
    /// - [`Options::evict_compaction_data_from_page_cache`] `true`: on
    ///   a device whose page cache is a few MiB, compaction streaming
    ///   through it would evict every hot foreground page. The hint is
    ///   `posix_fadvise(DONTNEED)` on Linux and a no-op elsewhere.
    /// - [`Options::max_key_size`] `16 KiB` and
    ///   [`Options::max_value_size`] `256 KiB`: the defaults accept an
    ///   8 MiB key and a 64 MiB value, either of which exceeds the
    ///   whole budget on its own. Capping a value at one write buffer
    ///   keeps a single accepted write from being one the memtable
    ///   cannot hold.
    /// - [`Options::compression`] stays [`CompressionType::Lz4`],
    ///   inherited from [`Options::default`]. It is pure Rust, its
    ///   block format needs no allocator tricks, and it reduces flash
    ///   writes, which is the resource that wears out.
    /// - [`Options::bloom_bits_per_key`] stays `10`: about a 1% false
    ///   positive rate for 1.25 bytes per key. Cutting it saves little
    ///   memory and costs real reads.
    /// - [`Options::partitioned_index`] stays `false`, so each open
    ///   SSTable's index is resident. That is the cheaper choice while
    ///   the per-file metadata term above stays small. Past roughly
    ///   100 MiB of database - about 400 files at this file size, or

    /// Tuning for a wasm module: `wasm32-unknown-unknown` in a

    ///
    /// wasm is not just a small machine, and that is why this is a
    /// separate profile from [`Options::embedded`] rather than an
    /// alias for it. Three properties of the platform drive every
    /// value that differs.
    ///
    /// # What makes wasm different
    ///
    /// - **There are no threads, and there is no way to wait for
    ///   one.** [`Options::max_background_compactions`] is `0` and on
    ///   a wasm target [`Options::validate`] rejects anything else,
    ///   so the failure arrives at the option rather than out of the
    ///   middle of [`crate::Db::open`]. Compaction runs on whichever
    ///   thread asks for it. Every other value here is chosen so that
    ///   the writer paying that cost pays it in small installments.
    /// - **There is no OS page cache.** This is the sharpest split
    ///   from [`Options::embedded`], which sets
    ///   [`Options::block_cache_size`] to `0` precisely because a
    ///   Linux-class board has a page cache to absorb the re-reads. A
    ///   wasm module has none, so a cache miss costs a host call and,
    ///   because [`Options::compression`] defaults to
    ///   [`CompressionType::Lz4`], a fresh decompression every time.
    ///   The cache here holds decompressed blocks, so it buys back
    ///   both. It is 1 MiB, and one shard, because a single-threaded
    ///   host never contends on it.
    /// - **Linear memory grows in 64 KiB pages and never shrinks.**
    ///   Every peak is permanent for the life of the instance, so the
    ///   figure to keep down is the high-water mark, not the average.
    ///   [`ArenaProfile::EMBEDDED`] caps a chunk at exactly one page
    ///   and the memtable pool hands the same pages to the next
    ///   memtable, so `memory.grow` runs once per size class rather
    ///   than once per flush-and-refill cycle.
    ///
    /// # Where the budget goes
    ///
    /// Up to 2 MiB of memtable entry bytes (a 1 MiB write buffer, at
    /// most one active plus one frozen), 1 MiB of block cache, and
    /// per-SSTable index and Bloom residency that grows with the file
    /// count. Skip-list node overhead sits on top of the entry bytes.
    /// Past roughly 100 MiB of database, set
    /// [`Options::partitioned_index`] to `true` to stop the per-file
    /// index term from growing without bound;
    /// [`Options::metadata_block_size`] is already 1 KiB here so that
    /// switch needs no further retuning.
    ///
    /// Measured, not estimated. The `embedded_profile` example run on
    /// `wasm32-wasip1` under wasmtime (open, 20000 x 128 B puts,
    /// sampled reads, page scan, compact, close, reopen, read back)
    /// reaches **4480 KiB** of linear memory, of which 3392 KiB is
    /// over the pre-open baseline, against **1600 KiB** for
    /// [`Options::embedded`] and **11456 KiB** for
    /// [`Options::default`] on the same run. Most of the gap over
    /// `embedded` is the block cache this profile buys and `embedded`
    /// declines, plus the larger write buffer. Linear memory only
    /// grows, so for a wasm module the high-water mark *is* the
    /// footprint. Reproduce with `just wasm-budget`.
    ///
    /// [`Options::evict_compaction_data_from_page_cache`] is `false`,
    /// unlike [`Options::embedded`]: the hint is `posix_fadvise` on
    /// Linux and a no-op everywhere else, so asking for it on wasm
    /// would imply an effect the target cannot deliver.
    ///
    /// [`Options::max_value_size`] is 1 MiB, exactly one write
    /// buffer, which is the same rule [`Options::embedded`] follows:
    /// a write the API accepts must fit in a memtable that can hold
    /// it. Raising it above [`Options::write_buffer_size`] is
    /// supported and costs a flush per outsized value, which on wasm
    /// is also paid in pages that never come back.
    ///
    /// # Not a promise about your workload
    ///
    /// These values bound what regolith reserves. They do not bound what
    /// your keys and values cost, nor what the allocator does with
    /// fragmentation. Measure in the target runtime.
    ///
    /// # It does not choose a filesystem for you
    ///
    /// On `wasm32-wasip1` the default [`Options::env`] works: wasi has
    /// a real `std::fs` behind a preopened directory. On
    /// `wasm32-unknown-unknown` it does not, because that target has no
    /// filesystem at all and every `std::fs` call reports
    /// [`std::io::ErrorKind::Unsupported`]. In a browser, mount OPFS
    /// and set the env yourself:
    ///
    /// ```ignore
    /// let opfs = OpfsEnv::mount("my-db", OpfsOptions::default()).await?;
    /// let mut options = Options::wasm();
    /// options.env = opfs.as_env();
    /// let db = Db::open(opfs.db_path(), options)?;
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Mounting is async, which is why the profile cannot do it.
    ///
    /// The profile is a plain value with no wasm-only fields, so it
    /// builds and opens on the host too, which is what lets it be
