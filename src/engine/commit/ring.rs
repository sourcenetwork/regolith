//! The commit ring: where every commit takes its place in the order, with
//! no lock (plan 4.7; `proofs/tla/CommitPipeline.tla`).
//!
//! A committer reserves a slot index with one atomic add on the ring's tail
//! and then installs its descriptor in the cell that index maps to. Every
//! later stage of the pipeline walks the indices in order. This module is
//! only the ring: who holds which index, which cell holds what, and the two
//! frontiers every thread advances together. What a slot means is
//! `pipeline.rs`.
//!
//! # A slot's life
//!
//! ```text
//! reserved --install--> READY --retire--> DONE
//!     \---void--------> VOID
//! ```
//!
//! - **Reserved.** The index is handed out and its cell still shows the
//!   index one lap earlier, finished. The owner has not installed yet.
//! - **READY.** The owner's descriptor is in the cell. Any thread may load
//!   it and work on the slot.
//! - **VOID.** A thread that reached the slot in ring order found it still
//!   only reserved, and voided it with one compare-and-swap of the cell's
//!   stamp. The owner's install then fails, and it reserves again. This is
//!   what stops a thread that stopped between its reservation and its
//!   install from holding every later commit behind it (model action
//!   `Void`).
//! - **DONE.** The slot is published and the cell may take the index one lap
//!   later.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - **R1, one fate per index.** A cell's stamp moves from "the lap before,
//!   finished" to `(index, READY)` or to `(index, VOID)` by one
//!   compare-and-swap, so an index is installed by its owner or voided by a
//!   helper, never both.
//! - **R2, the stamp fits one 64-bit word on every target** (D17): the slot
//!   index in the upper 62 bits and the phase in the lower two. Nothing in
//!   the ring needs a wider compare-and-swap, so armv7 and wasm32 take no
//!   emulation lock here.
//! - **R3, a loaded descriptor is alive.** A cell hands out its descriptor
//!   as a new `Arc`, taken while the loader is counted in the cell's `pins`.
//!   The cell's own reference is dropped only by a thread that moved the
//!   holder word to `LOCKED`, after the stamp said the slot is over
//!   (finished, voided or passed, none of which is undone), and then read
//!   `pins` as zero: a loader that validated the stamp earlier is still
//!   counted, and one that pins later fails the stamp check and never
//!   touches the pointer. A stamp that has not reached the slot yet is an
//!   install under way and is left alone. All four accesses are `SeqCst`,
//!   which is what makes "one of the two sees the other" hold
//!   (`sync::internal::seq_cst_handshake` says how loom is shown that).
//! - **R4, nobody waits for a cell.** A thread that finds a cell's holder
//!   word busy (another thread is inside the few instructions of an install,
//!   a load or a clean, or stopped there) does not wait: an owner gives its
//!   index up, voiding it, and reserves another; a cleaner leaves the cell
//!   for the next thread that passes. A void never touches the holder word,
//!   so a stopped thread cannot stop a slot from being voided. A slot whose
//!   publisher stopped before retiring it is retired by the thread that
//!   needs its cell a lap later.
//! - **R5, the frontiers only grow.** `decided` and `published` advance by
//!   compare-and-swap from one index to the next, so every slot is passed
//!   exactly once and in ring order, whichever threads do the passing. A
//!   rollback freezes both with a bit of the same word, so a pass that was
//!   under way when it began fails, and moves them itself when it is done.
//!
//! - **R6, a void slot does not keep its cell.** A cell holding a void slot
//!   takes the index one lap later, voided or installed, whether or not the
//!   frontiers have passed the void one: nothing is held for it. A frontier
//!   that reaches an index whose cell has moved on therefore passes it
//!   ([`Loaded::Gone`]): only a void slot's cell moves on before the
//!   frontiers pass, since a cell holding a descriptor is finished by the
//!   publisher, after both did.
//!
//! # The tip
//!
//! [`ArcSlot`] holds one `Arc` that any thread loads and that is replaced by
//! compare-and-swap: the newest decision of the pipeline (`pipeline.rs`), and
//! the current sync round. It is the same pin protocol as a cell's (R3) with
//! a list for the values a replacement could not drop at once.
