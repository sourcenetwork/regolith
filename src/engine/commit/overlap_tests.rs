//! Concurrent durable writers share an fsync, through the public API, with
//! the overlap made certain instead of left to the scheduler.
//!
//! One sync of the log covers every record written before it, so writers
//! that are inside the commit path at the same time share one. Threads
//! started together need luck to overlap: on one or two cores, or on a
//! filesystem whose fsync returns at once, each write can finish before the
//! next begins, and every write then pays for a sync of its own. So the test
//! holds the round, the one claim on the log's device step, as a thread in
//! the middle of a sync does, until every writer's first write is decided
//! and waits behind it, and only then lets go. That first sync is shared on
//! any core count and any filesystem.
