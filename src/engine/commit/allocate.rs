//! Reserving a range of a `u64` counter in the ordered step (plan 3.7).
//!
//! The counter lives at a key as the last value reserved, eight big-endian
//! bytes, absent meaning zero. `allocate` takes a slot of the commit ring
//! like a write: when its turn comes, whichever thread decides the slot reads
//! the counter from the state the slot before it left, reserves the next `n`
//! values, and puts the new counter in the slot's record. This follows
//! `Allocate.tla` and `Allocate.lean`:
//!
//! - The caller does no I/O for its own record. The call returns once its
//!   slot is decided, and the record is written by whichever thread brings
//!   the pipeline past the slot next: a later commit, a flush, close. It is
//!   in the log before the record of any commit made after the call
//!   returned, since that commit's slot comes later, and a sync covers a
//!   prefix of the log. So a crash that keeps a commit using a value keeps
//!   the reservation, and the counter recovers at or above every value in
//!   use. Nothing is handed out ahead of the log a commit depends on (RED
//!   LogAfterUse), and the counter is never part of a transaction's write
//!   set (RED InTxn), so it never conflicts.
//! - The record asks for no sync of its own. It becomes durable with the
//!   next sync, at the latest with the first commit that uses one of its
//!   values. Until its record is written and its slot published, a read of
//!   the key shows the counter before the reservation: the range handed
//!   back is the authority, not the key.
//! - A log failure discards every slot decided and not yet published, a
//!   reservation's included, after its range was handed out. The database
//!   goes on, and the caller still holds the range, so the rollback writes
//!   the discarded reservations' counters back before any later slot is
//!   decided ([`RegolithEngine::write_back_reservations`]), and latches the
//!   database if it cannot (RED ForgetOnRollback): no value is handed out
//!   twice without a crash either.
//! - The counter is read once: the pipeline's state keeps it from then on
//!   (`counters.rs`), so a later reservation of the key reads no device.
//! - It does not wait for write capacity. A stall delays commits, not the
//!   counter, and the record is a few bytes.
