//! Group commit: many concurrent writers, one WAL append, one fsync.
//!
//! A writer hands an owned [`WriteRequest`] to a bounded ring and parks.
//! Whichever thread holds the pipeline mutex is the leader: it drains the
//! ring, formats every pending record into one staging buffer, issues a
//! single `write_all` and at most one `fdatasync`, applies the whole group
//! to the active memtable, publishes the read horizon, and only then
//! releases the followers.
//!
//! Three invariants outrank throughput here, and every design choice below
//! is subordinate to them.
//!
//! * **the lost-update fix - the horizon trails durability.** `visible_seq` moves only after
//!   every record in the group is on stable storage *and* every operation
//!   is in the memtable, and always before any follower is released. A
//!   snapshot therefore cannot observe a torn batch.
//! * **G2 - a group fails as one unit.** When the append or the sync fails,
//!   the WAL is truncated back to the pre-group offset, nothing is applied,
//!   nothing is published, and *every* member of the group receives the
//!   error. No writer can believe it committed when the fsync did not.
//! * **G3 - an abandoned writer cannot wedge the ring.** The ring owns an
//!   `Arc` on the slot and the request is moved into the slot, so the
//!   leader never touches a frame that may have unwound, and a ticket is
//!   always completed and dropped exactly once.
//!
//! Groups do not pipeline. `visible_seq` is a single `fetch_max` watermark:
//! if a later group published its maximum before an earlier one applied, a
//! snapshot at that watermark would read a hole. Overlapping groups need a
//! per-commit completion tracker, which this module deliberately does not
//! have.
