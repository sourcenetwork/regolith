//! The column-family fence on every path a write takes into the pipeline.
//!
//! Each test makes a write that passed every check made before the pipeline
//! (the database's own handle check included) meet the drop of the family it
//! names only in ring order. The writer is stopped at a stage of the
//! pipeline with a test hook while the drop runs on another thread. Stopped
//! before it installed its slot, its reservation is voided by the drop and
//! it takes its turn behind the drop: it must be refused with
//! `InvalidColumnFamily`, take no sequence and leave nothing in the family's
//! key range. Stopped after, the drop decides the write first, at a lower
//! sequence, and its tombstone deletes it. Either way nothing is left in the
//! family, which is the contract (`proofs/tla/CfRegistry.tla`).
