//! Loom models of the commit pipeline (plan 4.7): the ring's reserve, install
//! and void, a cell taking its next lap, deciding with helping, the round's
//! claim, publication, and a rollback meeting a decision under way.
//!
//! # What runs the production code and what mirrors it
//!
//! The ring ([`Ring`]), the tip cell ([`ArcSlot`]), a slot's decision cell
//! ([`OnceArc`]), the round's job ([`Job`]) and the read horizon
//! ([`ReadHorizon`]) are the production types: their atomics come from
//! `crate::sync::internal`, so under `--cfg loom` they are loom's, and a
//! blocked thread parks through loom. The steps *between* them (decide,
//! settle, the rollback's freeze) live on the engine, which owns files and
//! a memtable loom cannot run, so the models repeat those few lines against
//! the production cells: [`help`] and [`settle`] are `pipeline.rs`'s
//! `help_decide` and `settle` with the engine taken out, and [`roll_back`]
//! is `ordered.rs`'s with the log and the memtable taken out. They are
//! protocol models and say so.
//!
//! # What was shrunk
//!
//! Every ring has two cells, the smallest that has a next lap. Every model
//! is two threads, or two and a reader, each doing one step of the
//! protocol, and is bounded by an explicit preemption bound, never by
//! time: the bound is what makes the search finish, and each model says
//! which bound it runs at. A bound of `n` still reaches every schedule in
//! which threads are switched away from at most `n` times while they could
//! have gone on, which covers each race here: each is a window between two
//! steps of one thread that one switch opens and one closes.
//!
//! # Calibration
//!
//! Each positive model has a calibration that writes one step the wrong way
//! out of plain loom atomics and must fail: a void that is not a
//! compare-and-swap, a cleaner that takes the descriptor of an install
//! under way, a stamp that does not release the pointer stored before it,
//! a replacement that reads the pins before its swap, a frontier
//! passed before the tip moved, a claim that is a load and a store, a
//! frontier published before the horizon, and a settle that does not look
//! at the epoch.
