//! A job of the commit pipeline that a queue's poll steps parks instead of
//! waiting for another thread (`park.rs`): for a round, a unit, the version
//! store's step, the flush exclusion and a failed log's writes in flight.
//!
//! Each test puts the thing in the job's way by hand, as a thread in the
//! middle of its work holds it, steps the job as a poll does, and checks
//! the four rules: the step returns without the thing (it did not wait),
//! the job holds nothing (K1), the end of the wait wakes it (K2), and the
//! next step finishes the work. Nothing is timed: a step that waited would
//! never return, since what it would wait for is released only after it.
