//! The write unit: how decided commits' records reach the log (plan 4.7,
//! D53; `WriteUnit` in `proofs/tla/CommitPipeline.tla`, `PipelineHelping.lean`,
//! the loom models in `loom_model.rs`).
//!
//! A host puts the writes of one file one after another, whoever makes them:
//! a positional write takes the file's lock, and a second writer spins on it
//! or sleeps. Sixty-four threads each writing their own record keep sixty-three
//! of them spinning in the kernel and buy nothing. So the records go to the
//! log in runs, one host write each, through a single-flight unit:
//!
//! 1. **Fill.** Once its slot is decided, a commit's owner encodes its record
//!    into its own descriptor's buffer and sets the slot's `FILLED` flag
//!    (D4 in `descriptor.rs`). Owners encode in parallel; nobody encodes
//!    another thread's record while holding anything.
//! 2. **Claim.** A thread that needs a record written claims the unit with
//!    one compare-and-swap of its word.
//! 3. **Gather.** The holder collects the run of filled, unwritten records
//!    that starts at the first one not written, in ring order, as long as
//!    their places follow one another in one log of one epoch: pointers to
//!    finished bytes, nothing encoded.
//! 4. **Count in, look again, write.** It counts the write in at the log's
//!    gate, looks at every gathered record again and keeps those before the
//!    first one another thread wrote meanwhile (WU3), and writes them with
//!    one vectored positional write.
//! 5. **Mark, let go, wake.** It counts out, marks each record written, lets
//!    the unit go, and only then wakes the threads parked on those records.
//!
//! # Who waits, and for how long
//!
//! A thread whose record is not written finds the unit claimed by another
//! thread, or (for another thread's record) the record not filled yet.
//!
//! - **A blocking commit** ([`Await::Park`]) spins about as long as one
//!   write takes, then parks on the record. Whoever writes it, fills it or
//!   fails it wakes it, and the holder that lets the unit go wakes the first
//!   parked record that is still waiting (WU4). Its patience is bounded: past
//!   [`PATIENCE`] since it first had to wait, or once the decided frontier
//!   moved [`FRONTIER_PATIENCE`] slots while the claim it saw stayed put, or
//!   with the ring full, it writes the record itself, as a copy through the
//!   gate (WU5). A holder that was preempted therefore stalls nobody for
//!   longer than that.
//! - **A `commit_nowait` call** ([`Await::Leave`]) spins as long, then leaves
//!   the unit on its queue: the job it waits on is released by the holder
//!   that lets the unit go, which tells every queue waiting on it (D53). It
//!   never waits for another thread.
//! - **A thread that holds the round or a unit, or runs a queue's poll**
//!   ([`Await::Copy`]) spins as long, then writes the record itself: commits
//!   wait for what it does, so it waits for nobody.
//!
//! A copy is the record's own bytes at its own place: the descriptor's
//! buffer when it is filled, or the same bytes encoded on the copying thread
//! from the decision. It counts in at the gate and looks again as a run
//! does, so no copy lands on a range a sync has begun to cover (WG4).
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - **WU1, one holder.** The unit is claimed by one compare-and-swap of its
//!   word and let go only by its holder, with one swap; at most one thread
//!   gathers and writes a run at a time.
//! - **WU2, nothing is encoded under the claim.** The holder only reads
//!   records whose owners filled them (D4), so the claim covers the gather,
//!   the count in, one host write and the marks: the window a preempted
//!   holder can stall, and the window a sync waits out at the gate, is one
//!   write long.
//! - **WU3, a run looks at its records after its count in.** Each record it
//!   writes was unwritten when the holder looked, after it counted in: a
//!   sync whose turn of the gate came first knew none of them written and
//!   covers none of them (WG4); the rollback that moved the epoch waits for
//!   the count out (WG2).
//! - **WU4, no lost wake.** A thread parks only after it is on the record's
//!   list with `PARKED` set (D5), and, for a filled record, after it marked
//!   the claim it saw as wanted; it then looks again. Whoever writes, fills
//!   or fails the record reads `PARKED` in the same read-modify-write, and
//!   the holder reads `WANTED` in the swap that lets the unit go. One of
//!   each pair sees the other.
//! - **WU5, a park is bounded.** A blocking waiter parks for at most
//!   [`PATIENCE`] in all before it writes the record itself, and the
//!   logical triggers end it sooner, without a clock: a preempted holder
//!   costs each waiter a bounded wait, never a scheduler's slice.
//! - **WU6, a run is bounded.** It holds at most [`MAX_BATCH_RECORDS`]
//!   records and [`MAX_BATCH_BYTES`] bytes, and no record past the decided
//!   frontier read when it began (or past the record the caller needs), so a
//!   call writes at most a ring's worth of records before its own and one
//!   run (P5 in `pipeline.rs`).
