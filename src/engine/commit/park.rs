//! What a call does about work in its way: wait for it, leave it, or park
//! (plan 4.10, D53).
//!
//! The pipeline hands nobody a turn. A call that finds a round or a unit in
//! its way runs it, or deals with the thread that already does, and what it
//! does then depends only on who is calling ([`Help`]):
//!
//! - **A blocking call waits.** It runs a unit nobody has, and waits for one
//!   another thread claimed, which is device I/O under way.
//! - **A `commit_nowait` call leaves.** It runs no unit and waits for none:
//!   the unit in its way goes on its queue and the call returns.
//! - **A queue's poll parks.** It runs what nobody has, as far as that goes
//!   without waiting. For anything another thread has, it registers its
//!   waker where that thread's work ends, gives back what it took, and
//!   parks its job (`engine::io::job`), so the poll goes on with the rest of
//!   its queue and never waits for another thread.
//!
//! # What a poll parks for
//!
//! Everything a job of the pipeline could wait for on another thread, and
//! where its waker goes instead:
//!
//! | in the way | the job is woken when | registered by |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | a round, a unit, a rotation check or a slot's decision another thread claimed | it lands, or that thread parks it | [`Job::watch`] |
//! | the version store's step, held by another thread | the step is given up | `Step::hold_or_park` |
//! | the flush exclusion, held by another thread | it is released | `Flusher::hold_or_park` |
//! | writes in flight on a log being rolled back | the last of them left | `Log::turn_away` |
//!
//! The first is met while helping, where every step is one any thread may
//! repeat: a job that parks there has changed nothing, and starts over when
//! it is woken. The last is met by a rollback before it has frozen anything.
//!
//! The other two are met inside a unit's body, which runs to its end once
//! begun. So the poll takes them *before* the body begins: a unit says what
//! its body may wait for ([`Needs`]), the poll takes exactly that, or parks,
//! and the body then finds it held by its own thread.
//!
//! A job that is no unit takes them the same way ([`RegolithEngine::keep`])
//! before each stretch of its work that flushes or changes the version set:
//! an owed background step, a stall's relief, and the parts of a foreground
//! job between its units (a drain's flushes, `compact_range`'s passes, an
//! ingest's file ids, a checkpoint's capture). A foreground job enters each
//! of its ordered units as any call does ([`Help`]), so a poll that runs it
//! parks at the unit's entry too (`engine::foreground`, "Where a poll
//! parks").
//!
//! # What still waits, and for whom
//!
//! A unit holds the version store's step and the flush exclusion for the
//! length of its body: a poll that needs either parks until the body ends,
//! and a blocking call waits for it.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - **K1, a parked job holds nothing.** Before it parks it lands the round
//!   it held and gives up the step and the exclusion it took, and nothing
//!   of a unit's body has run. Any thread may claim it and go on.
//! - **K2, a parked job is woken.** Every registration is followed by a
//!   second look at what it waits for, with a fence between that the side
//!   ending the wait matches, so one of the two sees the other.
//! - **K3, nothing a poll steps waits for another thread.** What a unit's
//!   body said it needs is held by its thread for the length of the body,
//!   and a job that is no unit keeps what a stretch of its work needs. Every
//!   blocking wait of the engine notes itself (`io::scope::waits`: the
//!   round, a unit, a commit that blocks, the version store's step, the
//!   flush exclusion, the compaction gate, a log's writes in flight), and a
//!   poll that reaches one fails a build with debug assertions.
//! - **K4, whoever waits on a parked job can run it.** A thread blocked on
//!   the job is woken when it parks and claims it; every queue registered
//!   on it is told when its wait ends, and never before the thread that
//!   parked it has let go of it, so a queue that is told finds it free to
//!   claim (`job.rs`).
