//! What a slot of the commit ring holds: the work a committer handed over,
//! and what the pipeline decided for it.
//!
//! A [`Descriptor`] is installed in the ring by its owner and then read by
//! every thread that helps the slot along, so everything in it is either
//! immutable (the work) or an atomic that only moves forward (the decision,
//! the stage flags). Nothing in it is ever taken back out: that is what lets
//! two threads work on one slot at once without a lock.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - **D1, one decision.** [`Descriptor::decide`] installs a slot's
//!   [`Decision`] by one compare-and-swap. Every thread that computed one
//!   for the slot proceeds with the one that was installed, whoever built
//!   it, so the sequences, the log position and the verdict of a slot are
//!   the same for every thread (model action `DecideCas`).
//! - **D2, stages are flags that are set once.** `APPLIED`, `WRITTEN` and
//!   `FAILED` are set by whichever thread finishes the stage, after its
//!   work, and never cleared. A thread that sees a flag set skips the stage;
//!   one that does not repeats work that is idempotent.
//! - **D3, a decision is a pure record.** It owns what later stages need
//!   (the batch a transaction's appends were numbered into, the record's
//!   place) and names the memtable and the log through its [`After`], so a
//!   stage never reads state that a later slot may have changed.
//! - **D4, a record is encoded once, by one thread, before it is shared.**
//!   The thread that claims [`FILLING`] (the slot's owner, or a thread that
//!   needs the record written and found nobody encoding it) encodes the
//!   slot's record into the descriptor's own buffer and then sets
//!   [`FILLED`]; nobody reads the buffer before that flag, and nobody writes
//!   it after. So the thread that writes a run of records (`write_unit.rs`)
//!   reads finished bytes and encodes none of them.
//! - **D5, a thread parked on a slot is woken.** It goes on the slot's list
//!   and sets [`PARKED`] in the flag word, then looks again at what it waits
//!   for; whoever sets [`FILLED`], [`WRITTEN`] or [`FAILED`] reads
//!   [`PARKED`] in the same read-modify-write and wakes the list. Two
//!   read-modify-writes of one word are ordered, so one of the two sees the
//!   other.
