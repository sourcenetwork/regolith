//! The write stall as a unit writers wait on, completed on each writer's own
//! queue when the stall clears (D23, plan 4.10).
//!
//! A write stopped by a stall threshold applies nothing and returns
//! [`WouldBlock::Stall`](crate::WouldBlock::Stall) at once, with a
//! [`StallWait`](crate::StallWait). Every writer stopped during one stall
//! waits on the same *passive* job (`engine::io::job`): no poll runs it, and
//! it lands only when the stall clears.
//!
//! - **Who clears it.** Whoever makes the progress that clears the stall
//!   re-classifies it here ([`StallSignal::refresh`]): a flush on a worker or
//!   on a writer's queue, a compaction pass, a rotation, an ingest. When
//!   writes are no longer stopped it lands the job, which pushes one
//!   completion to each stopped writer's queue and completes each wait with
//!   no queue directly.
//! - **No lost wakeup.** A writer gets or installs the job, registers its
//!   wait on it, and only then classifies the stall again: if the stall
//!   cleared in between, the writer lands the job itself. A clearer stores
//!   the level before it takes the job. So either the clearer finds the
//!   writer's job, or the writer sees the cleared stall.
//! - **Relief handed back.** On a database with no worker and inline
//!   compaction on, stopped writers relieve the stop themselves, and one
//!   whose step finds another thread's flush or job in the way waits for
//!   that thread instead. That thread may stop relieving with the stop
//!   still on: a write that ran its one owed step and returned, a job that
//!   ended, a relief that gave up. So there every piece of progress lands
//!   the job, stop or no stop, and each waiter looks again and relieves the
//!   stop itself or is contended anew. A waiter that saw the contention
//!   before such a landing and registered after it would miss it: progress
//!   is counted before the level is stored, the writer reads the count
//!   before its step and again once registered, and lands its own job when
//!   the count moved (`StallRelief.tla`, RED NoRecheck).
//! - **No thread waits.** Nothing here parks or sleeps; the slowdown delay
//!   and the timed wait a stopped writer used to park on are gone.
