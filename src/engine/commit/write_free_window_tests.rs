//! A commit that writes nothing, checked while another commit is in one of
//! the pipeline's windows (E50, `write_free.rs`): decided and not applied,
//! applied and not published, or discarded by a rollback.
//!
//! The worked example, the same as in `RepeatableRead.tla` (the read-only
//! anomaly), `Relaxations.lean` (`read_only_anomaly`) and
//! `tests/read_only_anomaly.rs`. A checking account holds 30 and a savings
//! account 0. A withdrawal reads both and takes 25 from checking, plus a fee
//! of 1 when the total it saw is under 35: having seen 30, it leaves 4. A
//! deposit puts 20 into savings. The withdrawal reads first, the deposit
//! commits, a report reads (30, 20), and the withdrawal commits checking = 4.
//! No order of the three gives the report's (30, 20) beside a final (4, 20):
//! the fee says the withdrawal came before the deposit, and the report says
//! the deposit came first. A report that checks its reads and commits after
//! the withdrawal was decided must be refused.
