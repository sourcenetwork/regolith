//! Numbering a commit's appends in the ordered step.
//!
//! A transaction's `append` calls queue as [`PendingAppend`]s and are not
//! read or validated for. The ordered step, which holds the pipeline mutex
//! and has already validated the commit's reads, gives each one the log's
//! next position and turns it into plain puts of the same atomic commit, so
//! the WAL carries final bytes. These rules follow `CommitOrderedAppend.tla`
//! and `Append.lean`:
//!
//! - Positions are assigned after validation, never before: a commit that
//!   fails validation reaches [`AppendOrder::number`] with nothing, so it
//!   takes no position.
//! - The head and the once keys come from the view plus the appends already
//!   numbered by this [`AppendOrder`], never from the view alone. One
//!   [`AppendOrder`] spans a commit group, so a later member counts from the
//!   head an earlier member left and sees the once keys it set.
//! - Nothing outlives the group: no cached head, no remembered once key. A
//!   group that fails drops its [`AppendOrder`] and the next group reads the
//!   view again, so a failure leaves no hole. A member that fails inside a
//!   group gives back what it took, so the members after it leave no hole
//!   either.
//! - Each member writes the head of every log it moved in its own record.
//!
//! A commit that carries no append never reaches this module.
