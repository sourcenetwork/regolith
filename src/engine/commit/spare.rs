//! The allocations a thread keeps between commits, so that a commit
//! allocates nothing for the pipeline's own objects.
//!
//! A commit needs a descriptor in the ring and a decision in the chain, and a
//! sync round needs the round and its job. Each is shared between threads
//! through an `Arc`, so each would be one allocation a commit, and the write
//! path had none of them before the pipeline. Instead, when the last
//! reference to one of them turns out to be this thread's, the thread moves
//! the value out and keeps the allocation, a *shell*, and its next commit
//! fills the shell instead of allocating. One thread committing on its own
//! reuses the same few allocations for ever; under contention a thread that
//! finds no shell allocates, as it would have.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - **S1, a shell has one owner.** It is made only from an `Arc` whose
//!   counts say it is unique: one strong reference, read before an acquire
//!   fence, and no weak one. Nobody else can reach the allocation, then or
//!   later: a weak reference is made only from a strong one, and the last
//!   other strong reference was let go of before the fence (its release
//!   decrement is what the read saw), so all its use of the value happened
//!   first. That is what [`Arc::get_mut`] asks too, with a locked
//!   compare-and-swap of the weak count it needs only against a weak
//!   reference being made at the same time, which takes a strong one.
//! - **S2, a shell holds no value.** The value was moved out when the shell
//!   was made, and the allocation is typed `MaybeUninit` from then on, so it
//!   is never read or dropped as a value again and pins nothing: no log, no
//!   memtable, no key.
//! - **S3, a thread keeps one shell of each kind.** A second one is freed, so
//!   what a thread holds back is bounded by four small allocations.
//!
//! A loom build keeps no shell: its `Arc` is the model's, and what is reused
//! here is memory, not a protocol.
