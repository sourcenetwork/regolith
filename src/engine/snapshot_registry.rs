//! Tracks the sequence numbers of every live snapshot so that compaction
//! can decide which older versions of a user key are safe to drop.
//!
//! Every [`Db::snapshot`](crate::Db::snapshot) and every transaction begin
//! pins a sequence here, and the handle releases it when it drops.
//! [`SnapshotRegistry::live_seqs`] lists the pinned sequences. Compaction
//! cuts a key's versions into stripes at them: inside a stripe only the
//! newest state is visible to any reader, so what lies beneath it can be
//! discarded and its operands folded, while nothing crosses a stripe
//! boundary (see `engine::compaction::stripes`).
//!
//! # Per-thread slots (plan 4.6, D54)
//!
//! There is no lock. Each thread number (`crate::per_thread`) owns a
//! cache-padded slot, and a thread announces the sequences it pins in its
//! own slot's entries (`chain`). An entry holds one sequence and a count
//! of the pins on it, so many snapshots at one sequence share one entry. A
//! pin records which slot and entry it is in, and its release goes exactly
//! there, on whatever thread drops the handle: a `Snapshot` or a
//! `Transaction` created on one thread and dropped on another releases
//! exactly what it pinned. Threads past the pool of numbers share slots;
//! every entry update is an atomic read-modify-write, so sharing costs
//! contention, never correctness.
//!
//! # The protocol (proofs/tla/SnapshotRegistry.tla)
//!
//! Registration, in the calling thread's slot:
//! 1. **announce**: read the horizon `h` and put `h` in an entry: join the
//!    slot's last entry if it announces `h`, otherwise claim a free one;
//! 2. **sample**: a `SeqCst` fence, then read the horizon again;
//! 3. **confirm**: if it still reads `h`, the snapshot is live at `h`.
//!    Otherwise take the announce back and announce the value just read.
//!
//! A compaction samples (a `SeqCst` fence) once its inputs are fixed, then
//! reads every slot. A clone adds a pin to the entry of the pin it copies,
//! which holds the sequence already, so it needs no confirm of its own.
//!
//! # Why it holds
//!
//! An entry's sequence does not change while it holds a pin (E1 in
//! `chain`), so a scan that reads an entry after a snapshot's announce
//! lists the snapshot's sequence. A scan that read it before the announce
//! put its fence before the registration's fence in the single order of
//! `SeqCst` fences; the registration's confirming read therefore sees every
//! sequence published before the scan's fence, so the snapshot reads at or
//! above every version the compaction's inputs hold. Either way the
//! snapshot loses nothing. Without the confirm, a reader could announce a
//! horizon read long ago after a scan passed its slot
//! (`MC_SnapshotRegistry_Red_NoConfirm`).
//!
//! # Slack
//!
//! The list never misses a live snapshot, and holds nothing but sequences
//! some registration read from the horizon and announced. It may hold more
//! than the live set: a pin released while the scan runs, or a registration
//! whose confirm is about to fail. So the minimum a compaction uses is at
//! most the oldest live snapshot, and below it only by sequences that were
//! announced during the scan.
//!
//! # Progress and cost
//!
//! - A release is one `fetch_sub`, plus one `fetch_and` when it frees the
//!   entry: wait-free.
//! - A clone is one `fetch_add`: wait-free.
//! - A registration is one join or claim in its own slot, a fence and two
//!   horizon loads. It repeats only when a commit publishes between those
//!   two loads, so it is lock-free: each retry is another thread's commit
//!   making progress. In a shared slot a claim also retries its
//!   compare-and-swap when another thread changed the same word.
//! - A scan reads every slot: the width of the pool plus each slot's
//!   chunks, touching only announced entries.
//!
//! # Memory
//!
//! A slot allocates its first chunk on its first pin and appends one when
//! every entry is taken; chunks stay until the registry drops. The total is
//! the peak number of distinct sequences each slot held at once, rounded up
//! to a chunk.
//!
//! # Waiting for the last snapshot
//!
//! [`SnapshotRegistry::wait_until_drained`] parks the calling thread until
//! every entry is free, with no mutex and no condition variable: the
//! waiter marks each chunk watched in the same read-modify-write that reads
//! its taken bits, and a release that frees an entry learns of the mark in
//! the read-modify-write that clears the entry's bit, then wakes the
//! waiters through a [`Notify`].
