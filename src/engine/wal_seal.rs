//! Sealed write-ahead logs: format 2 with every record's payload an AEAD
//! frame, and a stamp sealed under the key and durable before the log
//! exists.
//!
//! ```text
//! stamp   ["REGO"][format u16 = 2][flags u16 = 1][head check u32][nonce u64]
//!         [key id u32][stamp check u32][aead nonce: 12][tag: 16]
//! record  [len u32][kind u8][synced_through u64][payload check u32 = 0]
//!         [header check u32][aead nonce: 12][sealed operations][tag: 16]
//! ```
//!
//! The first twelve bytes are laid out as in every format, with flag bit 0
//! saying the log is sealed, so 0.1.x refuses the log as format 2. The
//! stamp check covers the 24 bytes before it, as in an unsealed stamp, so
//! a stamp damaged in place is told from one under a wrong key; the tag
//! seals the 28 bytes before the AEAD nonce under the key the stamp names.
//!
//! # The header keeps its check; the tag replaces the payload check
//!
//! Replay finds the records after a damaged one by testing every offset
//! for a header that verifies (`wal_frame::proof_past`). That test has to
//! stay one short hash, so the header check stays. Everything the payload
//! check did, the tag does: it covers the payload, and its associated data
//! is the header check's whole input (the log's nonce, the record's offset
//! and the header's fields), so it also binds the payload to its header,
//! its position and its log. The payload check field is written as zero.
//! `len` counts the frame, so a sealed record's payload is `len - 28`
//! bytes of operations; CLOSE seals an empty payload.
//!
//! # The stamp is sealed and durable at creation
//!
//! `proofs/tla/WalRecovery.tla` (RED `StampNotSealed`): with a wrong key
//! every record's tag fails, so no record can be read to prove anything
//! synced, P is 0, and the O < P rule would drop the whole log as a torn
//! tail. The stamp is therefore sealed under the log's key and made
//! durable before the log takes a record: a stamp whose tag fails refuses
//! the open instead. Creation writes the stamp to `wal_N.tmp`, syncs it,
//! renames it to `wal_N.log` and syncs the directory, so a crash leaves
//! either no log or a log whose whole stamp is durable, never one whose
//! stamp a crash tore and a wrong key cannot be told from.
