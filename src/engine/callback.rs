//! Containing a panic in code the caller supplied while regolith runs it on
//! its own account.
//!
//! A commit is the ordered step: the validation that precedes the write
//! pipeline and the group the pipeline's leader writes. A panic that unwinds
//! out of a caller's implementation there leaves the shared state of that step
//! half done, so [`contain`] catches it, names the trait, and the step's
//! boundary latches the database read-only.
//!
//! A background step, a flush regolith runs off any caller's call (on a
//! worker, or as the step a write owes on a database with no worker, E9), is
//! contained too, since there is no caller for the panic to unwind into, but
//! it latches nothing: it fails that step alone, which reports the failure and
//! is retried, as any failing flush is.
//!
//! Anywhere else nothing is caught: the panic unwinds into the call that ran
//! the code and fails only that call.
//!
//! Containment is a thread-local mode, because a flush is the same code
//! whoever runs it.
