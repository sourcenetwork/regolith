//! External-table ingest without a rewrite (D48, E8).
//!
//! An ingest moves a table built outside the database into it in two phases.
//!
//! **Staging** holds no lock, so writers never wait for it. The file is
//! copied into the table directory, or hard-linked when the caller lets it
//! move, and synced; then the copy is validated where it will be served
//! from: key and value sizes, live column families, and one entry per user
//! key, which is what lets every entry read at one sequence.
//!
//! **Installing** runs holding the compaction gate alone, which keeps every
//! level below L0 as it is and lets L0 only grow, and does in an ordered
//! unit of the commit pipeline only what has to be ordered against commits:
//!
//! 1. flush the memtables holding a key of the table's range, so writers
//!    wait for a flush only when there is an overlap;
//! 2. place the table: the deepest level L such that no L0 table holds a
//!    key of its range and no table of levels 1..L overlaps it, else the
//!    front of L0 (LsmOrder.tla, `Ingest = "Placed"`; Lean
//!    `ingest_ordered`). A flush in step 1 lands in L0 holding such a key,
//!    so it places the table in L0;
//! 3. sync the active log, so every commit ordered before the ingest is
//!    durable before the ingest is: the memtables step 1 left alone may
//!    hold commits only the log has (IngestDurability.tla);
//! 4. draw the table's sequence;
//! 5. one manifest edit adds the table, recording the sequence its entries
//!    read at (`SsTableMeta::global_seq`), and raises the last sequence;
//! 6. publish the sequence on the read horizon.
//!
//! The install draws and publishes in one ordered step of the commit
//! pipeline, so from the draw to the publish the sequence is a pending slot
//! no publication passes
//! (IngestPublication.tla, `RepeatableSnapshot`; Lean
//! `repeatable_snapshot`). A snapshot taken before the publish reads none of
//! the table, whose entries read at the new sequence, and one taken after
//! reads all of it.
//!
//! Which L0 tables hold a key of the range is read before the ordered step,
//! since it can read a block; inside the step only a table that arrived in
//! L0 since then is probed.
