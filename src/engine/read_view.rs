//! The published read view: the one object a reader loads to obtain a
//! consistent set of LSM sources.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! * A [`ReadView`] is immutable once published. Every mutation of the
//!   memtable set or of the current version publishes a **new** view;
//!   nothing ever mutates a view a reader may be holding.
//! * The view is the single source of truth for the active memtable and
//!   the frozen memtable list. `RegolithEngine` owns no separate copy.
//! * Successive published views only ever move data in the "older"
//!   direction (active -> frozen -> version) and never lose it, so a
//!   reader holding an older view sees a subset of the data a newer
//!   view exposes, never a different one.
//! * The `Arc<Version>` a view holds pins every `Arc<LiveSst>` in it,
//!   and each `LiveSst` holds the SSTable's open file descriptor. A
//!   compaction may unlink a table's path the instant it leaves the
//!   current version; a reader holding an older view keeps reading it
//!   through that descriptor. This view composes with that existing pin
//!   chain by adding one level to it, and does not duplicate it.
//! * Lock order: [`VersionStore`] mutex -> [`ReadViewCell::publish`]
//!   mutex -> `ReadViewCell::current` write lock. Nothing acquires the
//!   `VersionStore` mutex while holding either of the latter two.
//!   Readers acquire only `current`, shared.
//!
//! # Why the version half is published by the store, not by callers
//!
//! Every version change goes through [`VersionSet::apply`], which is
//! only reachable through a [`VersionGuard`]. The guard compares the
//! version it entered with against the one it leaves with and publishes
//! the difference, so a foreground flush, an ingest, a `drop_all` and a
//! background compaction all refresh the view without any of them
//! having to remember to.
