//! Models of a column family's create, drop and use racing (plan 4.6).
//!
//! A protocol model, and deliberately so. The production registry
//! (`column_family::CfRegistry`) keeps liveness in a kovan map, whose
//! atomics loom does not see, and the ordered step is the commit leader
//! under the pipeline mutex, which needs a whole engine. What is reproduced
//! here is the part loom can decide, each piece standing in for one line of
//! `engine::commit::families`:
//!
//! - the family's liveness is one atomic word that moves unborn, live, dead
//!   and never back (`CfRegistry::publish`, `retire`: one map write each,
//!   and ids are never reused);
//! - the ordered step is one mutex, and inside it a write takes the next
//!   sequence (`run_group`'s `fetch_add`);
//! - a write checks the family in the ordered step before it takes a
//!   sequence (`cf_fence` at admission);
//! - a drop takes the tombstone's sequence in the ordered step and retires
//!   the family before it leaves it (`drop_family`);
//! - a create publishes the family in the ordered step after its meta
//!   entry's sequence (`create_family`).
//!
//! The rule checked: every write that lands has a sequence below the drop's
//! tombstone, so the tombstone deletes it, and every write after the drop is
//! refused. A reader watching the family sees unborn, live and dead in that
//! order. The calibration checks the family outside the ordered step, as a
//! fence at the API boundary alone would, and must fail.
