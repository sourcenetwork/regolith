//! Models of parking (`engine::commit::park`): a job a queue's poll steps
//! parks instead of waiting for another thread, and nobody who waits is
//! left behind.
//!
//! Six handshakes carry it. In each, two sides write one word and then
//! read the other's, and a side that misses the other sleeps for ever:
//!
//! - a job its holder parks, against a thread blocked on it (`io::job`,
//!   K4 in `commit::park`);
//! - a job parked for a thing another thread holds, against the thread that
//!   gives the thing up (`io::parked`, PK1), driven here through the
//!   version store's step, which the flush exclusion shares the list with;
//! - a rollback parked for the writes in flight on a failed log, against
//!   the last write to leave (`wal_gate`, WG1 and WG3);
//! - a sync parked for a copy of a record still in flight, against the
//!   copy's way out, and a copy counted in after the turn, against the
//!   record written (`wal_gate`, WG4);
//! - the wake of a parked job telling the queues registered on it, against
//!   the thread that lands it (`io::job`, `Job::ready`);
//! - that wake against the park itself: a wait that ends before the thread
//!   that stepped the job gave its claim up (`Job::ready` and `Job::watch`
//!   against `Job::step`).
//!
//! Each positive model drives the production type, whose atomics, fences
//! and parking are loom's under `--cfg loom`. Each calibration rebuilds the
//! handshake out of plain loom atomics with one thing wrong, and must fail
//! its assertion. A side that would sleep says so instead of sleeping, and
//! the model then asks whether anybody woke it: a thread loom finds asleep
//! for good unwinds through the model's threads and stops the test process,
//! which a calibration cannot expect. Only the first model parks for real,
//! through the job's own code.
//!
//! # What was shrunk
//!
//! Two threads a model (three where a second queue polls), one parked job,
//! one thing held, one write in flight, two queues. Every model is bounded
//! by an explicit preemption bound, never by time.
