//! Loom models of the snapshot registry (`engine::snapshot_registry`): the
//! slot and thread-number claims, the release of a moved pin, the sample
//! and confirm, and the drain waiter's wake.
//!
//! Every atomic the registry touches comes from `crate::sync::internal`, so
//! loom sees the taken bits, the pin counts, the sequences, the chain links,
//! the hint, the horizon and the `SeqCst` fences. A chunk holds three
//! entries under loom (`chain::ENTRIES`), so a few pins fill one and the
//! models also grow chains. Loom regards `SeqCst` loads and stores as
//! `AcqRel` but models `SeqCst` fences, which is why the protocol's
//! ordering rests on fences alone: the models check the code as built.
//!
//! Every model runs at a preemption bound of three (`LOOM_MAX_PREEMPTIONS`
//! overrides it): the largest, three pinning threads in one slot, explores
//! about 0.7 million schedules there in under a minute of release build;
//! unbounded, the three-thread searches run for hours without reaching a new
//! kind of interleaving.
//!
//! Four calibrations must fail: a registration that skips its confirm, a
//! confirm with no fence after the announce, and a scan with no sample
//! fence are each missed by a scan; and a drain waiter that does not mark
//! the chunks it read is never told of the release it waits for.
