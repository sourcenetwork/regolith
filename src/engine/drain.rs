//! A drain: memtables seen through to tables for a caller that needs them
//! there, as work that can stop where it would wait (plan 4.10).
//!
//! `compact_range` flushes the active memtable before it reads L0, a
//! checkpoint and a close flush every memtable, and so does an explicit
//! flush. Each is the same two steps. An ordered unit of the commit pipeline
//! seals what has to be sealed and names the memtables to flush, the
//! *targets*. Then the oldest frozen memtable is flushed, again and again,
//! until every target has left the frozen list.
//!
//! A call that blocks runs the two in one go. A job a queue's poll runs may
//! not wait for another thread (`commit::park`), and both steps would: the
//! unit for a round or a unit ahead of it, each flush for the flush
//! exclusion and for the version store's step. So a drain is a value that
//! remembers where it is ([`Drain`]), and [`RegolithEngine::drain_advance`]
//! takes it as far as it goes: to its end for a caller that waits, or to
//! the first thing another thread holds for a poll, which parks there and
//! goes on from the same place when it is woken.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - **DR1, the targets are fixed by the unit and never extended.** A drain
//!   that looked at the view again each pass would chase the memtables
//!   writers seal after it began, and under a steady write load never
//!   finish: a checkpoint taken while anything writes would hang.
//! - **DR2, a parked drain holds nothing.** Between two calls it holds no
//!   exclusion and no step. Its unit, once in the ring, is run by whichever
//!   thread reaches its slot.
//! - **DR3, flushes go oldest first, whoever asked** (`LsmOrder.tla`): each
//!   pass flushes the oldest frozen memtable, so a target is reached only
//!   after every memtable sealed before it. L0 files carry no sequence of
//!   their own and readers take the most recently added as the newest, so
//!   flushing out of order would publish an older file over a newer one.
