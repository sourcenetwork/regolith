//! Insert-only concurrent skip list over a bump [`Arena`].
//!
//! One node is a single arena bump holding its header, tower, key bytes
//! and value bytes inline, so a steady-state write touches the global
//! allocator zero times. A general-purpose concurrent map would instead
//! cost three heap allocations per write (internal key, value, node)
//! plus the garbage its reclamation scheme defers.
//!
//! # Node layout
//!
//! One variable-length allocation, [`NODE_ALIGN`]-aligned:
//!
//! ```text
//! offset  0 : u32                    key_len     internal-key bytes
//! offset  4 : u32                    value_len
//! offset  8 : u8                     height      1 ..= MAX_HEIGHT
//! offset  9 : [u8; 7]                padding     keeps the tower aligned
//! offset 16 : [AtomicPtr<u8>; height] tower      level 0 first
//! offset 16 + PTR*height             key bytes
//! offset 16 + PTR*height + key_len   value bytes
//! ```
//!
//! # Concurrency contract
//!
//! Exactly one thread inserts at a time (the engine serializes writers on
//! its write lock); any number of threads read concurrently and lock-free.
//! [`ArenaSkipList::insert_with_hint`] is the same single writer with a
//! private splice: it takes an [`InsertHint`] bound to one list and, for
//! a key that sorts after the hint's position, starts its descent there
//! instead of at the head. See [`InsertHint`] for the invariants (H1 to
//! H3) that make a hint safe to reuse across a whole run of inserts.
//!
//! The safety of the whole module rests on these invariants, named at
//! every `unsafe` site that relies on them. They are what the loom and
//! miri models exist to check.
//!
//! - **S1 (publication).** Every byte of a node - header, tower, key and
//!   value - is written before the single `Release` store that links it
//!   into level 0. A reader that observes the node through an `Acquire`
//!   load therefore observes it fully initialised.
//! - **S2 (single writer).** At most one thread is inside `insert` at a
//!   time. A `debug_assert`-backed flag catches a violation in test and
//!   debug builds.
//! - **S3 (no unlinking).** No node is ever removed. A `next` pointer
//!   observed once stays a valid node pointer until the whole arena dies.
//! - **S4 (provenance).** Every node pointer derives from the pointer
//!   `Arena::alloc` returned for that node; none is synthesised from an
//!   integer and none crosses chunks.
//! - **S5 (aliasing).** `NodeRef::key` and `NodeRef::value` form `&[u8]`
//!   over regions that are never written again after S1, and no `&mut`
//!   to any node byte exists once the node is published.
//! - **S6 (bounds).** `key_len` and `value_len` are written by the same
//!   code that sized the allocation, so both slices stay inside the
//!   node. `insert` refuses a key or value that does not fit a `u32`,
//!   which [`crate::Options::validate`] makes unreachable.
//! - **S7 (height in range).** `random_height` returns `1 ..= MAX_HEIGHT`,
//!   and every tower walk is bounded by the node's own height, so no
//!   read runs past the tower into the key bytes.
//! - **S8 (`Send` + `Sync`).** The only cross-thread communication is
//!   through the tower's `AtomicPtr`s, and the only mutation is by the
//!   single writer: S1 plus S2 plus S3.
//! - **S9 (head sentinel).** The head is a standalone allocation owned
//!   by the list, so its address is stable for the list's life and an
//!   untouched memtable reserves no arena chunk at all.
//!
//! The arena's own invariants (A1 to A8), which these build on, are
//! documented in [`super::arena`].

/// - **H1 (shape).** Once bound, `prev[l]` is the head or a node of

///   head counts as minus infinity) and `next[l+1].key >= next[l].key`
///   (null counts as plus infinity). This is what lets one bracket check
///   at level `L` vouch for every level above it.
/// - **H3 (adjacency is advisory).** `next[l]` was `prev[l]`'s successor
///   at level `l` when the hint was last written. A plain `insert` in
///   between may have linked a node there; the hint is never trusted on

/// exact splice for the new key `T` (`prev[l]` is the last node at level
/// `l` with key below `T`, `next[l]` the first at or above it), and
