//! The write-ahead log: the durable record of every write between one
//! memtable flush and the next.
//!
//! # On-disk format
//!
//! A WAL file opens with a self-checksummed stamp and is followed by a
//! sequence of records:
//!
//! ```text
//! ["REGO"][format: u16 LE][reserved: u16 LE = 0][stamp checksum: u32 LE]
//! [len: u32 LE][type: u8][payload: len bytes][checksum: u32 LE]
//! ...
//! ```
//!
//! # A log with no stamp
//!
//! The stamp is written when the log is created, before any record, so a
//! file whose first four bytes are not `REGO` is one a crash caught
//! during creation: no write from it was ever acknowledged, and it holds
//! no record to lose. Such a file is discarded rather than parsed, and
//! the discard is recorded so an open still fails when a *later* log
//! yielded records, which would make the missing bytes a hole in the
//! history rather than its end.
//!
//! A stamp can never be read as a record header. `REGO` as a
//! little-endian `len` is 0x4F47_4552, about 1.3 GiB, and
//! [`MAX_RECORD_LEN`] caps a record far below that.
//!
//! The checksum covers the length, the type byte and the payload, so the
//! length field is both what finds the next record and part of what the
//! checksum protects.
//!
//! # How replay tells a crash from corruption
//!
//! Replay runs after something has already gone wrong, so it has to
//! separate the ordinary shape of a crash from real damage. The question
//! it asks of each record is whether the record is *whole*: a record is
//! whole when the file holds its five-byte header, the `len` payload
//! bytes that header promises, and the four checksum bytes after them.
//!
//! * A record the file ends inside is not whole. That is what a process
//!   killed part way through a `write` leaves behind, so replay stops
//!   there, keeps every record before it, and reports the discarded tail
//!   through `tracing`. No acknowledged write is lost by that: under
//!   `DurabilityMode::Immediate` a write returns only once the `fsync` of
//!   its own whole record has returned, and under `Eventual` no
//!   durability was promised in the first place.
//! * A whole record that fails its checksum, carries an unknown type, or
//!   does not parse is corruption, and is an error. A torn write cannot
//!   produce it: every byte the record claims is present, and they are
//!   wrong.
//! * An incomplete record from which the rest of the file still parses as
//!   whole records, ending exactly at the last byte, is not a torn tail
//!   either. A torn write leaves nothing behind it, so a remainder that
//!   tiles that way means real records lie beyond the damage and the
//!   length field was mangled; stopping there would discard them
//!   silently. Replay refuses, naming the file and both offsets.
//!
//! Two limits of that rule are worth stating, because both are properties
//! of the format rather than of this implementation.
//!
//! The checksum sits after the payload, so the length has to be trusted to
//! find it. Damage to the length field of the *final* record is therefore
//! indistinguishable from a torn tail and is treated as one. The blast
//! radius is that one record, the discard is reported, and no partial or
//! invented data is ever served.
//!
//! Damage in the middle of a log whose final record is *also* torn leaves
//! a remainder that no longer tiles, so it reads as a torn tail starting
//! at the earlier damage and the whole rest of the log is discarded. That
//! needs bit rot and a crash in the same short-lived file, and the discard
//! is reported with the offset and the byte count rather than passing
//! silently.
//!
//! The stamp closes neither of those: it is checksummed for itself, not
//! for the records after it. Closing them needs per-record framing that
//! does not depend on a trusted length, such as fixed-size blocks, and
//! the stamp's `format` field is what lets that arrive without breaking
//! the logs written before it.
