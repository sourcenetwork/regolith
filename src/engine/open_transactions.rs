//! The transactions still open that have something to run when the database
//! closes: the ones with an `on_abort` callback, and every one under a
//! database with transaction hooks.
//!
//! `close` aborts each of them (see `transaction::claim`), so a callback
//! never waits on a caller that will not return. Nothing is listed for a
//! transaction without callbacks or hooks, and the table is built by the
//! first one that is, so a database that uses neither pays nothing. Listing
//! one is a slot taken and given back ([`claim_slots`]).
//!
//! A pessimistic database also lists its lock table here: `close` releases
//! the key locks of the transactions it aborted and wakes every transaction
//! waiting for a lock, which then fails with `Closed`.
