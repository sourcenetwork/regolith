//! The gate every write of a positional log passes: what keeps the write of
//! a discarded commit from landing after the rollback that discarded it cut
//! the file, and any write from landing on a range a sync has begun to make
//! durable (`wal_log.rs`).
//!
//! One word holds the log's write epoch and the number of writes in flight.
//! A write is counted in by a compare-and-swap that succeeds only while the
//! word still carries the epoch the write was decided in, and counted out
//! when its bytes are with the host. A rollback moves the epoch on, keeping
//! the count, and cuts the file once the count is zero.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - **WG1, a write of an older epoch never starts.** Its count in compares
//!   the epoch in the same step that counts it, so once the epoch moved no
//!   such write is counted in, and none writes uncounted.
//! - **WG2, after the epoch moved the count only falls.** Nothing is decided
//!   in the new epoch until the rollback that moved it is over, so the
//!   writes in flight then are the ones let in before, each of which leaves
//!   once. The rollback waits for exactly those, and for no thread that
//!   merely looked at the gate.
//! - **WG3, a rollback that may not wait is woken by the last write to
//!   leave.** A job a queue's poll steps registers its waker and looks at
//!   the count a last time; the write that takes the count to zero under a
//!   moved epoch wakes the waker registered. One of the two sees the other.
//!
//! # A sync and the writes in flight (WG4)
//!
//! A sector being written when the power goes may come back garbled,
//! whatever bytes were being written to it: a disk without power-loss
//! protection promises nothing for a sector in flight. So no write may land
//! on a range of the log once a sync that covers the range has begun.
//! Putting synced bytes back in flight, even the very same bytes, would let
//! a power cut take commits that were durable. The pipeline writes one
//! record from two threads when a claim's holder is slow to reach it (a
//! copy, `commit::write_stage`), so a late copy of a record is the case to
//! rule out.
//!
//! So a write also counts in on one of two sides, the one the gate names
//! when it enters, and then looks again at whether its record is written
//! already: one that is leaves without writing. A sync of the written
//! prefix first turns the gate to the other side, then waits until every
//! write counted on the side it turned away from has left. A write counted
//! in before the turn has returned before the sync begins; one counted in
//! after it finds every record of the prefix written, and writes none of
//! them. Writes of records past the prefix go on meanwhile, on the new
//! side: a sync waits for the writes in flight when it began, never for a
//! stream of new ones.
//!
//! - **WG4, no write lands below a sync's prefix after the sync began.**
//!   The turn and a write's count in are each a read-modify-write of the
//!   side word, and so is a sync's look at the side word when it finds
//!   nothing in flight and turns nothing. Read-modify-writes of one word
//!   are ordered one after another, so every write is on exactly one side
//!   of the sync's: before it, and the sync sees it in flight and waits; or
//!   after it, and then everything the sync knew before it, the written
//!   records among it, is known to the write once it counted in (the sync's
//!   read-modify-write releases, the write's acquires), so the write sees
//!   its record written and writes nothing. No fence on the write's side:
//!   the cost is one read-modify-write per sync, not a fence per write.
//! - **WG5, a turn is waited out once.** The turn and the prefix it was
//!   made for are kept until the side it turned away from has drained, so a
//!   sync that parked and runs again finishes its own turn rather than
//!   turning again behind newer writes, and syncs no further than that
//!   prefix. Only the holder of the pipeline's round turns or settles the
//!   gate, so one turn is outstanding at most.
//!
//! # The write claim (WG6)
//!
//! Writes of one file are put one after another by the host whatever the
//! caller does: a positional write takes the file's lock, and a second
//! writer spins or sleeps on it. So the log's records reach it one batch at
//! a time (`commit::write_stage`): a write that counts in may take the
//! log's write claim in the same read-modify-write of the side word, and
//! the claim is let go in the one that counts it out. The holder gathers
//! the records waiting to be written after it counted in, so it looks at
//! each record after its count in, exactly as a single write looks at its
//! own (WG4).
//!
//! - **WG6, one claim, let go with the count out.** The claim is a bit of
//!   the side word, set only by a count in that finds it clear and cleared
//!   only by the count out of the write that set it. A writer that finds it
//!   set and parks counts itself among the claim's waiters, in the same
//!   word, before it looks at the claim a last time; the count out that
//!   lets the claim go reads that count in its own read-modify-write. One of
//!   the two sees the other: the waiter finds the claim free and takes it,
//!   or the holder sees a waiter and wakes the next writer in line.
