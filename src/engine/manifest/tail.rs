//! The end of a manifest whose replay stopped short of it (E29), and the
//! one reader of a batch, which replay and the judgment share.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! [`VersionSet::apply`](super::VersionSet::apply) syncs each batch it
//! appends before it returns, unless every record in it only reserves file
//! ids or retires logs ([`ManifestRecord::requires_sync`]), and one apply
//! runs at a time. So at a power cut, the bytes no completed sync covers
//! are a run of batches that needed no sync, then at most one batch whose
//! sync was under way, written last. A crash damages only those bytes.
//!
//! Replay stops at the first batch that does not read back whole, at
//! offset O. Whether O lay in that unsynced run is decided by the bytes
//! after it, the way plan 4.2 decides it for a write-ahead log:
//!
//! - A batch after O that reads back whole, needed a sync, and has bytes
//!   after it proves O durable: those bytes were written only once its sync
//!   had completed, and that sync covered every byte before it. The open
//!   refuses, naming the file, O, and the end P of that batch. No crash
//!   leaves this state.
//! - With no such batch, a crash can have left every byte from O on, and
//!   the open drops them as an unsynced tail and reports it.
//!
//! A crash may cut that tail short, zero it, fill it with unrelated bytes or
//! tear it at a sector. A checksum that holds by chance in unrelated bytes,
//! about one test in 2^32, can only refuse an open that could have
//! succeeded, never open one that should not.
//!
//! # What it cannot see
//!
//! Damage to the last batch that needed a sync, with no batch needing a
//! sync after it, reads exactly like that batch's sync never completing:
//! the open drops it and reports it, never silently. A write-ahead log has
//! the same residual in its last synced group (plan 4.2, item 5).
//!
//! The judgment also assumes a crash never leaves a whole batch of an
//! older manifest where the unsynced tail was: such a batch would verify
//! wherever it landed, because a batch does not carry its offset. No tear
//! the fault shim models does that, and neither does ext4 in its default
//! ordered mode.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! Nothing for a manifest that replays whole. For a damaged one, every
//! offset after O is tested once; a test reads a 4-byte length and stops
//! there unless the batch it claims fits in the file, which on zeros, text
//! and random bytes it almost never does.
