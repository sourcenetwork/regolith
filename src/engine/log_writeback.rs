//! The log writeback lane: a thread that hands the active write-ahead log
//! to the device's writeback as it fills, so the rotation that seals it
//! finds little left to sync (E46).
//!
//! A rotation makes the log it seals durable before the next log exists
//! (E2, `Ordered::seal`), inside the ordered step where every writer waits
//! for it. Synced whole there, a log of a full write buffer stalls every
//! writer for as long as the host takes to write it out. So each log calls
//! a kick each time it grows by an eighth of the write buffer
//! (`wal_log::EarlyWriteback`), and this lane starts the writeback of what
//! writers passed ([`crate::env::LogFile::start_writeback`]): no sync, no
//! claim on the pipeline, no durability promised, only pages the seal's
//! sync then finds written. Where the host has no such hint, nothing is
//! started and the seal writes the log as before.
//!
//! Off unless the caller turns it on ([`crate::Options::log_writeback`]):
//! the lane is a thread beyond the compaction threads the database
//! otherwise keeps to (plan 3.13 and 4.5), so asking for it is the caller's
//! call. Off, no log has an early writeback, and a record's write costs one
//! branch on `None`.
//!
//! A thread of its own, not a job for the compaction workers: a worker is
//! busy for the length of a flush or a compaction pass under exactly the
//! load that rotates, and writeback waiting behind one is writeback the
//! seal does itself. Not on the writer's thread either: starting writeback
//! costs the caller the host's work of writing the pages out, compression
//! included on a filesystem that compresses, which the writer would pay on
//! the commit path. Not a sync of the log ahead either: on btrfs a sync
//! holds the file against writes while it runs, and syncing ahead measured
//! slower there than the one sync at the seal.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - **One writeback asked for at a time.** A kick while one is asked for
//!   and not begun is dropped: the one that runs covers what that kick asked
//!   for too.
//! - **Nothing waits for the lane.** A kick is a flag and a channel send;
//!   writeback the lane has not started is writeback the seal does.
//! - **Only a kick starts writeback.** An idle database is not touched on
//!   a timer.
