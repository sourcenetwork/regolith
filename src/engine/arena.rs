//! Bump allocator for one memtable, with tiered chunk sizing and a
//! bounded recycling pool.
//!
//! One [`Arena`] backs one memtable. Every skip-list node, key and value
//! that memtable holds is a bump allocation inside one of its chunks, so
//! [`Arena::used_bytes`] is the memtable's true payload cost (node
//! header, tower, key and value, rounded to alignment) and
//! [`Arena::reserved_bytes`] is exactly what was taken from the global
//! allocator to hold it.
//!
//! # Tiering
//!
//! Chunks are powers of two. Chunk `n` is `initial_chunk_size << n`,
//! capped at `max_chunk_size` and stepped back down so the arena never
//! reserves a class larger than what is left of its budget. A single
//! entry larger than `max_chunk_size` gets a dedicated, exactly-sized
//! chunk instead of raising the cap for everyone. See [`ArenaProfile`].
//!
//! # Recycling
//!
//! A dropped arena hands its chunks to a shared [`ChunkPool`] rather
//! than to the global allocator, and the next memtable takes them back.
//! The pool is bounded in **bytes** by
//! `write_buffer_size * max_write_buffer_number`; chunks offered past
//! that bound are freed immediately, because an unbounded cache of
//! chunks is a memory leak with better manners.
//!
//! # Lifetime, and why a refcount rather than epoch reclamation
//!
//! The memtable is insert-only: no node is ever unlinked and no node is
//! ever freed on its own. The only lifetime question is "may this chunk
//! be recycled yet", and an `Arc<Arena>` refcount answers it exactly.
//! Every live [`crate::DbSlice`] taken from a memtable holds one, so a
//! chunk cannot return to the pool while a reader still points into it.
//! Per-node safe memory reclamation would have nothing to reclaim here.
//!
//! # Safety invariants
//!
//! Named at every `unsafe` site that relies on them, and the target of
//! the miri model:
//!
//! - **A1 (layout).** Every chunk is allocated with
//!   `Layout::from_size_align(size, CHUNK_ALIGN)` and freed with the
//!   identical layout. `ChunkHandle` carries its own `size`, so `Drop`
//!   and [`ChunkPool::give`] cannot disagree about it.
//! - **A2 (range).** `alloc` checks the fit before forming a pointer,
//!   because constructing an out-of-range pointer is undefined even if
//!   it is never read.
//! - **A3 (alignment).** Chunk bases are `CHUNK_ALIGN`-aligned by A1 and
//!   the bump cursor is only ever advanced to an aligned offset, so
//!   alignment is inductive.
//! - **A4 (initialisation).** Bytes handed out by `alloc` are
//!   uninitialised, and nothing reads them before the caller fills them.
//! - **A5 (lifetime).** A chunk's bytes stay valid until `Arena::drop`,
//!   which needs the last `Arc<Arena>` to die. Every live
//!   [`crate::DbSlice`] taken from the memtable holds one. This is the
//!   entire recycling safety argument.
//! - **A6 (ownership).** [`ChunkPool::give`] transfers a chunk exactly
//!   once: it is either moved into a ring slot or dropped. A full ring
//!   hands it back, and that path frees it, so nothing is leaked and
//!   nothing is freed twice.
//! - **A7 (accounting).** `parked` is incremented only by the size of a
//!   chunk that really entered a ring, and decremented only by the size
//!   of one that really left, so it can neither underflow nor
//!   over-report the bound.
//! - **A8 (single allocator).** At most one thread is inside
//!   [`Arena::alloc`] at a time, and no other code reads `state` while
//!   the arena is live. The only production caller is
//!   `ArenaSkipList::insert`, which already holds the skip list's
//!   single-writer guard (S2), and the engine runs that on the commit
//!   leader only. `alloc` carries its own debug guard so the contract is
//!   checked at the arena, not inferred from its caller; under loom the
//!   cell is instrumented and any unordered access fails the model.
//!   Readers never depend on `state`: a reader learns a node's address
//!   only through a tower link loaded with `Acquire` (S1), and the chunk
//!   acquisition, the cursor bump and every node byte write are
//!   sequenced before the writer's `Release` store of that link, so they
//!   happen-before the reader's use with no further fence. `Arena::drop`
//!   runs with `&mut self` after the last `Arc<Arena>` is gone; `Arc`'s
//!   Release decrement and Acquire fence order the writer's last cursor
//!   write before the drain, the same argument that already justifies
//!   `get_mut` there.
//!
//!   Ordering summary: `state` is plain, non-atomic memory, touched only
//!   by the A8 thread and never read by a reader. `used` and `reserved`
//!   stay `Relaxed` atomics; other threads read them for statistics, but
//!   neither guards a memory access. Reader visibility of a freshly
//!   grown chunk's bytes is unchanged: S1's `Acquire`/`Release` pair on
//!   the tower link. Pool hand-off is unchanged: `ChunkPool::take`/`give`
//!   go through the MPMC ring, and a chunk arriving from a dead arena was
//!   released by that arena's `drop`.
