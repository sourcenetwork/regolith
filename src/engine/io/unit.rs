//! One unit of device I/O, run once however many queues wait on it.
//!
//! A unit is born in the `Free` state when the first `CacheOnly` read misses
//! its block. It moves through these states:
//!
//! ```text
//! Free --claim (one CAS)--> Claimed --finish--> Done
//!   ^                        |
//!   |                        +--park: a reopen found no open-file slot
//!   +--unpark (one CAS)-- Parked
//!   \--release (close, a dropped queue): from Free or Parked, claim, then
//!      finish with nothing--/
//! ```
//!
//! The claim is the only way to `Claimed`, so the work runs on one thread
//! at a time and finishes at most once. A run whose reopen under
//! `max_open_files` found every slot busy does not wait (D60): it puts its
//! work back and parks the unit, and the slot table tells the queue that ran
//! it when a slot frees; that queue's poll unparks the unit and runs it
//! again. A parked unit is still in flight: reads of its block join it, so
//! the block is read once.
//!
//! `finish` writes the outcome, publishes `Done`, and then closes the list of
//! waiting queues with one swap and pushes one `Done` message to each queue
//! on it. A queue that registers after that swap is refused and reads the
//! outcome itself. So every queue that registered gets exactly one
//! completion, and none is lost.
