//! One unit of I/O that is not a block read, run once however many queues
//! wait on it (D53).
//!
//! regolith hands every piece of I/O a non-blocking caller owes to the queue
//! of the thread that asked for it, as a job:
//!
//! - a sync round of the commit pipeline, which every commit it covers
//!   waits on, and which the first of their threads to poll runs
//!   (`engine::commit::round`); an ordered unit of the pipeline, and the
//!   decision of a slot left to a thread that may read the device, are jobs
//!   too (`engine::commit::ordered`, `engine::commit::read_mode`);
//! - the bounded step of background work a write left owing with no worker,
//!   on the writing thread's queue (`engine::background_step`);
//! - the stall a stopped write waits out, which does no work of its own and
//!   lands when the stall clears (`engine::commit::stall`);
//! - a foreground job with no worker: `compact_range`, an ingest, a
//!   checkpoint (`engine::foreground`).
//!
//! A job is a [`Flight`]: claimed by one compare-and-swap and landed once,
//! pushing one `JobDone` to every queue that registered on it. A waiter with
//! no queue (a blocking call, a ticket whose caller has none) listens on the
//! job directly and is told by the thread that lands it, and a thread that
//! blocks on the job parks until then.
//!
//! A *passive* job has no body: no poll ever runs it, and only the event it
//! stands for lands it, through [`Job::release`]. That is the stall: its
//! readiness is the stall clearing, which a flush or a compaction makes
//! happen elsewhere.
//!
//! # Parking
//!
//! A queue's poll never waits for another thread, so it runs a job through
//! [`JobBody::step`]. A job whose next step needs something another thread
//! holds (a foreground job needs the compaction gate) does not wait for it:
//! it registers the waker its step was given where the wait ends and hands
//! itself back ([`Step::Parked`]). The job gives its claim back and stays on
//! its queue, not runnable. When what it waits for may be free, the waker
//! pushes [`Message::Ready`] to the queue, which wakes an idle owner once,
//! and the owner's next poll claims the job and steps it again. The message
//! sits in the inbox until the owner takes it, so a wake that comes before
//! the job finished parking is not lost. A parked job is still found and
//! settled by close, by its queue's drop, and by a blocking
//! [`JobTicket::wait`](crate::JobTicket::wait), each through a claim.
//!
//! A job several callers wait on (a unit of the commit pipeline) may be
//! parked by one of them while the others wait for it. None of them is left
//! waiting on a thread that is no longer running it:
//!
//! - **Who waited for the thread that held the claim is told when it parks.**
//!   A thread blocked in [`Job::wait_turn`] wakes and claims the job itself.
//!   A job that parked because this one was claimed ([`Job::watch`]) is
//!   woken, and its next step claims this one.
//! - **Every queue registered on the job is told when its wait ends**, not
//!   only the one that stepped it ([`Job::ready`]): a queue whose claim lost
//!   while the job was being stepped dropped it from its line, and the owner
//!   of the queue that parked it may never poll again. Whichever owner polls
//!   next steps it. They are told while the job is free to be claimed: a
//!   wait that ends while the thread that parked the job still holds its
//!   claim tells them when that thread lets go.
