//! A lock-free stack whose head word carries two flag bits.
//!
//! The per-thread queues need three kinds of list that many threads push to
//! and one party takes whole: a queue's inbox, the queues waiting on a unit,
//! and the tasks waiting on one read. Each is this stack. A push is one
//! compare-and-swap on the head word; a take is one swap that empties the
//! stack and sets the flags the taker chooses, so changing a flag and taking
//! the list it governs are a single step.
//!
//! - An inbox uses [`IDLE`]: its owner sets the flag on an empty inbox before
//!   it sleeps, and the one push that clears it is the push that wakes the
//!   owner. A dropped queue's inbox is taken with [`SHUT`], so every later
//!   push is refused.
//! - The waiters of a unit and the wakers of a read use [`SHUT`] as "done":
//!   the take that closes the list refuses every later push. A push either
//!   lands before the take, and the taker serves it, or is refused, and the
//!   pusher sees the outcome for itself. Nothing is served twice and nothing
//!   is lost.
//!
//! Nodes leave only in whole lists, never one at a time, so the push
//! compare-and-swap cannot suffer ABA: a node address that reappears at the
//! head is a new push onto a list nobody else is walking.
