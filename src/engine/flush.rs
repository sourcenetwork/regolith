//! Writing a frozen memtable out to an L0 table, by whoever flushes it.
//!
//! A [`Flusher`] holds what a flush touches (the read view, the version set,
//! the table directory, the options, the background health) and nothing of
//! the engine around it. The engine and its compaction workers share one, so
//! a worker flushes what writers sealed (E9) without holding a handle on the
//! engine: dropping the last handle on a database closes it there and then,
//! and a worker never runs the engine's teardown.
//!
//! Every flush takes the `flushing` exclusion and the oldest frozen memtable,
//! so frozen memtables install in L0 in the order they were sealed, whichever
//! thread flushes (`LsmOrder.tla`, RED FlushAnyOrder).
