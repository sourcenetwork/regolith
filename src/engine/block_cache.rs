/// * `true`: the shard refuses the insert and leaves the caller to
///   use the block directly; nothing is cached.

/// A budget of 0 disables the cache: no shard is allocated, every
/// `get` misses, every `insert` is dropped, and the block-cache
/// tickers stay at zero.
///
/// # Allocation
///
/// Everything the cache allocates is driven by the byte budget, never
/// by the shard count: a shard's map and ring are not created until the
/// shard's first insert, the map's bucket array is then sized from that
/// shard's share of the budget, and each entry is charged
/// [`Block::charge`] plus [`ENTRY_OVERHEAD`] for the map node, the ring
/// slot, and the `Arc` headers that `Block::charge` cannot see. An empty
/// shard costs 96 bytes, measured with a counting global allocator at 1,
/// 4, 16, 64 and 128 shards, so the empty-cache footprint is flat in the
/// shard count rather than proportional to it.
///
/// Two costs `usage()` does not cover, both measured, neither growing
/// without bound:
///
/// * [`ENTRY_OVERHEAD`] under-charges the real bookkeeping by about 8%
///   (138.6 bytes measured against 128 charged).
/// * The map defers reclaiming an evicted entry's node until no reader
///   can still be traversing the bucket it sat in. The node holds the
///   key and a [`Weak`], so what it defers is the entry's own
///   allocation and never the block's bytes: those are freed under the
///   ring mutex the moment the hand takes the slot.
///
/// Together those put live heap above the budget at saturation by a
/// margin that is NOT bounded today, and this is a known open defect
/// rather than a documented cost. Measured on the small-block probe:
/// 3.8x the byte budget after 40,000 inserts through a 2 MiB cache, and
/// 9.3x after 120,000. It grows with churn, not with the working set,
/// so a long-running database keeps climbing.
///
/// The cause is that the map's retired nodes are not reclaimed in this
/// process without an explicit `kovan::flush()`, and calling that from
/// a live thread while readers hold guards corrupts memory: the block
/// cache's own adversarial test aborted with SIGSEGV and with a
/// misaligned pointer dereference inside the map's own traversal.
/// `force_remove` rather than `remove` closes a separate hazard, a
/// stale version of a key becoming visible again, but it does not
/// change retention at all: both measure the same bytes.
///
/// The map's reclamation guard is taken and dropped inside each map
/// call, so no guard is ever held across a lock acquisition or a wait,
/// and a stalled reader delays reclamation without ever blocking an
/// insert.
///
/// # Why the ring keeps a mutex
///
/// Only inserts and evictions take it; `get` does not. Sharding is what
/// keeps it off the critical path, and the effect is large: measured on
/// a 36-core x86_64 box over a fully resident working set, the shipped
/// 64-shard cache holds 31.4 Mops/s at 8 threads against 30.4 at one,
/// while the same code at a single shard collapses from 30.9 to 2.1.
/// Making the ring lock-free too would still have to publish the
/// reference bit and the byte total somewhere, and on the two targets
/// where regolith cares most it would be a loss rather than a win:
/// single-threaded wasm never contends the lock at all, so every extra
/// read-modify-write is pure overhead, and a target with no
/// compare-and-swap emulates one with a critical section, which is a
/// global lock and strictly worse than a sharded one.
