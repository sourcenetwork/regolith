//! An asynchronous reader-writer lock its holders may lock again, keyed
//! by [`Owner`].
//!
//! The lock counts owners, not calls. An owner that already reads reads
//! again at once, even with a writer owed a handoff, because that writer
//! waits for this owner's read anyway; an owner that writes may also read.
//! An owner that reads without writing and asks to write is refused with
//! [`ReadHeldByOwner`]: the write would wait for its own read. So an owner
//! never deadlocks on itself.
//!
//! Each reading owner has a record (owner id, read depth) in a lock-free
//! list that only grows: a record is reused once its owner stops reading,
//! so the list is as long as the most owners that ever read at once.
