//! The wait queue and the drain role every primitive builds on.
//!
//! A [`WaitQueue`] is one state word, a lock-free stack of arriving waiter
//! nodes, the owed count, and the node pool. The five low bits of the
//! state word belong to the queue; a primitive keeps its own state in the
//! bits above them.
//!
//! # The drain role
//!
//! A drain pass is the only code that sorts arrivals, grants or nudges
//! waiters and prunes withdrawn ones, so it is single-consumer by
//! construction and its lists need no synchronization of their own. The
//! role is a bit in the state word, and nobody ever waits for it:
//!
//! - Every operation that may let a waiter run (a release, a new waiter, a
//!   withdrawal, a notification) ends in a [`Step::Drain`] transition: one
//!   compare-and-swap that applies the operation's own state change and
//!   either claims the role or, when another thread holds it, sets the
//!   dirty bit.
//! - The holder clears the dirty bit, then takes the arrival stack, runs
//!   its primitive's pass, and gives the role up with a compare-and-swap
//!   that requires the dirty bit still clear. If anything changed while it
//!   worked, that swap fails and it passes again.
//!
//! So every change made while a pass runs is seen by that pass or by a
//! later one, and every change made after the role is given up claims it
//! afresh: no wakeup is lost, and no call waits on another thread.
//!
//! Arrivals push onto a Treiber stack. Pushing is ABA-safe because nothing
//! pops single nodes: a pass takes the whole stack with one swap and
//! reverses it into arrival order.
//!
//! # Barging with bounded bypass
//!
//! The lock-like primitives let a caller take what is free even while
//! others wait, so a release never waits for a suspended task to run. A
//! release with waiters *nudges* the oldest ones it could serve: they stay
//! queued, are woken, and compete again when polled. [`NUDGE_OUT`] marks a
//! nudge whose waiter has not polled yet; releases skip the drain pass
//! while it is set, since a wake is already on its way.
//!
//! A nudged waiter that loses again counts one bypass. The attempt that
//! would be its [`MAX_BYPASS`](super::MAX_BYPASS)th loss marks it owed
//! first, then either takes what it asks for or raises the [`HANDOFF`]
//! bit in the same compare-and-swap. While the bit is up every barging
//! acquire is refused, so what a release frees stays parked in the state
//! word for the drain pass, which hands it to the waiters in queue order;
//! the bit clears once no owed waiter is left. No release can fall between
//! the last loss and the bit: one ordered before the swap is seen by it,
//! and the waiter takes what it freed. So a waiter is passed over at most
//! `MAX_BYPASS` times.
