//! Owner tokens: who holds a reentrant lock.
//!
//! A reentrant lock lets its holder lock it again. "Its holder" cannot be
//! the current thread, because a task can move between threads and many
//! tasks can share one; so the reentrant locks take an [`Owner`] instead.
//!
//! Soundness rests on one rule: every guard an owner holds lives on one
//! thread at a time. A reentrant guard hands out `&T`, and two threads
//! holding `&T` to a `T` that is not `Sync` (a `RefCell`, say) would race.
//! So an `Owner` can move between threads but cannot be shared across
//! them or cloned, and every reentrant guard and future borrows the
//! `Owner` it was taken with, which pins it to that owner's thread for as
//! long as it lives.
