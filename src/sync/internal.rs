//! The atomics and locks the engine builds on, and how its threads wait.
//!
//! Everything here has two implementations selected by `cfg(loom)`. A
//! normal build takes `std::sync`; a `--cfg loom` build takes
//! `loom::sync`, whose instrumented mocks are the only accesses loom
//! can see. A `std::sync::atomic::AtomicPtr` is invisible to the model
//! checker, so anything that wants to be model-checked imports from
//! here rather than from `std` directly: the arena, the skip list, the
//! memtable, the read horizon and the commit pipeline all do.
//!
//! The loom mocks are only usable inside a `loom::model` call, so
//! `cfg(loom)` is a model-checking build and nothing else.
//!
//! # Why the wrapper exists
//!
//! [`Mutex`] is a thin newtype rather than a re-export because `std`
//! poisons a lock whose holder panicked and hands back a `LockResult`,
//! while the engine has no use for poisoning: a panic in one thread must
//! not convert every later lock acquisition in every other thread into a
//! second panic, which is how a single failing assertion turns into a torn
//! shutdown. The wrapper recovers the guard with
//! [`std::sync::PoisonError::into_inner`] and hands it back directly, so a
//! caller sees the lock's contents exactly as the panicking thread left
//! them and deals with it as ordinary state.
//!
//! The wrapper serves the structures later phases replace (the commit
//! pipeline, the version set). No blocking reader-writer lock and no
//! condvar is left: the read view, the snapshot registry and the key lock
//! table that used them are lock-free. The engine's background state, its close and
//! its compaction gate use the lock-free [`crate::sync`] primitives instead,
//! and a thread that has to wait on one of those waits through [`block_on`]
//! or [`wait_here`], below.
//!
//! [`UnsafeCell`] and [`SingleWriterGuard`] live here for the same reason
//! as everything else: a `std::cell::UnsafeCell` is invisible to loom, so
//! state that is mutated without a lock (the arena's chunk list, A8 in
//! `engine::arena`) goes through the wrapper here instead, and the debug
//! guard that catches a broken single-writer contract is shared by the
//! arena and the skip list rather than duplicated between them.
